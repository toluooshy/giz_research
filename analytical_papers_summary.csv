0,"The research analyzes multiple blockchain land registry pilot programs conducted globally, including in Honduras, Georgia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Zambia, Brazil, Ghana, Rwanda, Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, Colombia, Liberia, South Africa, Kenya, Sweden, United States (Wyoming, Vermont, Illinois), Ukraine, Russia, Netherlands, Japan, Bermuda, Australia, and Canada. These pilots involved various technology providers such as Factom, Bitfury, Chromaway, Medici Land Governance, Ubiquity, IBM, Peersyst, Seso Global, Propy, Landfolio, and local startups. The pilots varied in success, with many facing political, funding, and institutional obstacles rather than technical failures.","The study was conducted and completed in 2024, with data collection including a 2020 survey and analysis of pilot programs from approximately 2015 through 2024.","The research employed an interdisciplinary approach combining political science, technology, and business methods. It utilized surveys of land registry professionals, qualitative unstructured interviews with industry experts and pilot participants, analysis of public policy guidelines, factor modeling, elementary design science research, and case studies of blockchain land registry pilot programs worldwide. Additionally, the author developed an index and conducted factor analysis to assess country suitability for blockchain land administration.","Key themes include the political and technical feasibility of blockchain technology in land administration, the predominance of political obstacles over technical ones, the importance of institutional quality and governance, the role of technological infrastructure such as internet penetration and digitization of land records, the impact of incumbents and vested interests resisting change, and the potential economic and social benefits of blockchain land registries in improving transparency, reducing corruption, and increasing access to credit. The study also explores historical land reform contexts, blockchain economics, and the comparative analysis of developed versus developing country pilots.","Failures or stalled progress in blockchain land registry pilots were primarily due to political resistance, entrenched interests, funding obstacles, lack of political will, corruption, institutional weaknesses, and challenges in change management. Notably, technical shortcomings were rarely cited as the primary cause of failure. Examples include the Honduras pilot which stalled due to political reasons, Brazil's pilot halted due to opposition from officials fearing displacement and cost concerns, and Bermuda shelving its pilot due to economic considerations. Other pilots faced delays or limited scaling due to similar political and institutional challenges.","Successful or moderately successful pilots were characterized by strong political support, stable governance, digitized land records, and institutional reforms. Examples include Georgia's pilot which enhanced security and transparency, Rwanda's ongoing pilot supported by stable institutions, Sweden's pilot demonstrating efficiency gains despite legal limitations, and several U.S. pilots in Wyoming and Vermont with strong state-level backing. The factor analysis indicated that countries with higher internet penetration, rule of law, and quality land administration were more conducive to successful blockchain adoption. Hybrid blockchain approaches and integration with existing systems also contributed to pilot successes.","The overall sentiment of the research is cautiously optimistic about the potential of blockchain technology to improve land administration but emphasizes that political and institutional challenges are the primary barriers to adoption rather than technical limitations. The author advocates for continued research and experimentation, highlighting that blockchain is a tool that requires a certain level of institutional maturity to be effective. The study underscores the need to overcome vested interests and build political will to realize blockchain’s benefits in land governance, while acknowledging that blockchain is not a panacea but a promising innovation in the broader context of land reform.",BLOCKCHAIN LAND REGISTRY BEST PRACTICES THE POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF HARNESSING BLOCK.pdf
1,The paper does not describe a specific pilot study but proposes a novel Actor-Network Theory-based Responsible Development Methodology (ANT-RDM) for blockchain development.,Not specified; the paper is a comprehensive analysis published in 2024 and references blockchain developments up to 2023-2024.,"The paper employs a theoretical and methodological approach based on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to analyze blockchain development. It introduces the ANT-RDM methodology, which includes four stages: problematization, interessement, enrolment, and mobilisation. The methodology integrates socio-technical perspectives, considering both human and non-human actors in blockchain ecosystems.","The main themes include the technical challenges of blockchain (scalability, security, privacy, interoperability, energy consumption), business and adoption challenges, social, ethical, environmental, and regulatory controversies, and the proposal of responsible blockchain development principles (STEADI: sustainable, transparent, ethical, adaptive, decentralized, inclusive). The paper also discusses governance, inclusivity, and the dynamic nature of blockchain networks from an ANT perspective.","Blockchain technology faces significant failures including scalability issues due to the scalability trilemma, multiple layers of security vulnerabilities (hardware, data, network, consensus, smart contract, application layers), privacy challenges due to pseudonymity and immutability conflicting with data protection laws, interoperability problems caused by heterogeneous platforms and governance models, high energy consumption especially in Proof of Work systems, business adoption barriers such as high costs and regulatory uncertainty, social and ethical issues like the digital divide and privacy conflicts, environmental degradation linked to mining, potential misuse for illicit activities, and centralization risks in governance models.","Blockchain has demonstrated potential to revolutionize various sectors including manufacturing, healthcare, finance, supply chain, energy, and legal systems by improving information sharing, traceability, and operational efficiency. It offers enhanced security features like immutability and decentralization, supports transparency and auditability, and can promote sustainability through energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and circular economy applications. The Ethereum transition to Proof of Stake significantly reduced energy consumption, and blockchain enables inclusive governance and diverse stakeholder participation when responsibly developed.","The paper adopts a balanced and constructive sentiment, acknowledging both the significant challenges and controversies surrounding blockchain technology and its transformative potential. It advocates for responsible blockchain development guided by the STEADI principles and the ANT-RDM methodology to address existing failures and achieve sustainable mass adoption.",Responsible Blockchain STEADI Principles and the Actor-Network Theory-based Development Methodology.pdf
2,"The paper draws on the author's own research work in the Pacific region, including case studies such as the World Food Program’s Building Blocks project in Syrian refugee camps, Oxfam’s Unblocked Cash disaster relief blockchain in Vanuatu, and blockchain initiatives in Papua New Guinea and Fiji. These pilots illustrate the intersection of blockchain humanitarianism with neoliberal governance, public-private partnerships, and crypto-colonialism.","Not explicitly specified; however, the paper references developments and projects primarily from the late 2010s through 2021, with some ongoing research by the author in the Pacific region over the preceding four years.","The study employs a critical political economy approach combined with interdisciplinary analysis, integrating political economy, critical theory, and psychoanalytic political theory. It includes qualitative analysis of blockchain humanitarian projects, policy documents, public relations materials, and ethnographic insights from the developing world, particularly the Pacific. The author also reviews secondary sources such as reports, news articles, and blockchain white papers to contextualize findings.","Key themes include the entanglement of blockchain humanitarianism with neoliberal public-private partnerships, the ideological and rhetorical framing of blockchain as a universal technological solution, the obscurantist and sectarian nature of blockchain technology, the role of blockchain in perpetuating crypto-colonialism and value extraction from the developing world, the PR and solutionist hype surrounding blockchain projects, ethical concerns regarding digital identity and governance, and the failure of blockchain to deliver transformative social outcomes in humanitarian contexts.","Blockchain humanitarian projects fail to address the inherent risks and ideological extremism of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They often operate within opaque, proprietary platforms that lack standardization and are difficult to transpose into complex social governance systems. Projects like the World Food Program’s Building Blocks and Oxfam’s Unblocked Cash reveal issues such as centralization, reliance on incumbent financial intermediaries, user illiteracy, regulatory conflicts, and the perpetuation of existing power asymmetries. Furthermore, blockchain initiatives in developing countries frequently embody colonial logics, enabling techno-experimentation that undermines sovereignty and facilitates value extraction rather than empowerment.","While large-scale transformative successes are limited, some blockchain humanitarian projects have achieved modest cost and time savings, such as Oxfam’s Unblocked Cash in disaster response. Projects like Building Blocks have pioneered the use of blockchain-inspired digital identity and cash aid distribution in refugee camps, serving as proof-of-concept platforms that attract further collaboration within the humanitarian cash ecosystem. These initiatives have also succeeded in generating significant media attention and institutional legitimacy for blockchain technology within the aid sector, thereby advancing the broader crypto-economy’s interests.","The overall sentiment of the paper is critical and cautionary. It challenges the techno-utopian and solutionist narratives promoted by blockchain advocates and highlights the ethical, political, and practical shortcomings of blockchain humanitarianism. The paper underscores the inseparability of blockchain projects from crypto-colonialism, neoliberal governance models, and speculative economic logics, expressing skepticism about the prospects for ethically sound and socially transformative blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector.",Blockchain humanitarianism and crypto-colonialism.pdf
3,"The UnBlocked Cash pilot was a four-week project conducted in 2019 in two urban communities, Pango and Mele Maat, on the island of Efate in the Republic of Vanuatu. It aimed to test a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based cash and voucher assistance (CVA) system using the Dai (DAI) stablecoin wrapped in a Crypto Collateralized Voucher (CCV) and distributed via near-field communication (NFC) cards to recipients and vendors.","The pilot was conducted over a four-week period in 2019, with two rounds each lasting two weeks: the first round in Pango community and the second in Mele Maat community.","The research combined field data collection by Oxfam staff with platform data from Sempo and ConsenSys to evaluate supply chain performance across time, cost, and quality dimensions. Methods included participant registration, real-time monitoring, surveys (over 520), six key informant interviews, four focus group discussions, and internal staff interviews. The study also involved detailed onboarding and community engagement activities, and analysis of transaction data from the DLT platform.","Key themes included the use of DLT and stablecoins for humanitarian cash transfers, transparency and security of transactions, user experience with NFC cards and mobile apps, operational efficiency in onboarding and cash-out processes, challenges with existing financial service providers, community engagement and inclusion of vulnerable groups, and scalability and sustainability of blockchain-based CVA systems.","The pilot revealed several limitations including the inability to fully disintermediate existing financial service providers due to regulatory and infrastructural constraints, reliance on a single technical expert creating a single point of failure, hardware delays and failures related to device variability, limited connectivity affecting real-time synchronization, challenges in cashing out vendors efficiently, and usability issues such as confusion over dashboard terminology and occasional user difficulties with NFC cards and app PINs. Additionally, the system's transparency was limited for recipients due to technological literacy barriers, and privacy concerns arose from real-time monitoring.","The pilot successfully demonstrated the first use of a stablecoin (DAI) in CVA, showing modest cost savings and significant time savings in onboarding recipients (average 3.6 minutes per individual compared to over an hour in previous responses). The NFC card technology allowed offline transactions preventing double-spending despite poor internet connectivity. The system improved transparency and security by recording transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. User experience was overwhelmingly positive, with 100% of surveyed participants preferring this form of assistance over traditional methods. The platform enabled real-time monitoring and responsiveness to participant needs, reducing manual reconciliation efforts and operational costs.","The overall sentiment of the report is cautiously optimistic. While acknowledging the challenges and limitations encountered, the authors view the pilot as a promising proof-of-concept demonstrating that DLT-based CVA can improve operational efficiency, transparency, and user experience in humanitarian cash transfers. The report emphasizes the need for further research, scaling, and refinement, particularly in addressing disintermediation, technical support, and community engagement to realize the full potential of blockchain technologies in this sector.",UnBlocked Cash Piloting accelerated cash transfer delivery in Vanuatu.pdf

13,"The study was conducted in Lagos, Nigeria, a pioneering CBDC nation, focusing on individuals' attitudes and intentions towards adopting the eNaira, Nigeria's central bank digital currency.",Data collection occurred between November 2021 and March 2022.,"The study employed a multi-method approach combining partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Data were collected via a questionnaire distributed using snowball and convenience sampling, yielding 310 completed responses. Measurement scales were adapted from prior literature, and common method bias was assessed and found negligible. Theoretical frameworks integrated include the valence framework, social cognitive theory (SCT), and theory of reasoned action (TRA).","The research explored factors influencing CBDC adoption, focusing on affordance-based positive valences (financial inclusion, seamless transactions, perceived superiority, time convenience), constraint-based negative valences (cognitive effort, perceived financial cost, perceived risk), and social cognitive factors (lifestyle compatibility, trust in the central bank, subjective norms). It also investigated the relationship between attitudes and usage intentions towards CBDC.","The study identified low active usage of Nigeria's eNaira (<2% of the population) despite early launch, highlighting barriers such as perceived financial cost and cognitive effort. Perceived risk and social cognitive factors like trust in the central bank and subjective norms were not significant predictors of attitude in this context. Additionally, blockchain-related concerns such as security vulnerabilities and regulatory uncertainty may contribute to public skepticism, though these were not statistically significant barriers in this study.","Affordance-based positive valences, particularly seamless transactions, time convenience, and the societal benefit of financial inclusion, emerged as strong predictors of positive attitudes and usage intentions towards CBDC. The study identified necessary conditions for high CBDC use intentions including seamless transactions, trust in the central bank, positive attitude, and financial inclusion. Six alternative sufficient configurations for high usage intention were also revealed, demonstrating multiple pathways to adoption. The integrative theoretical approach and multi-method analysis provided comprehensive insights into CBDC adoption dynamics.","Overall, the sentiment of the study is cautiously optimistic. It emphasizes the importance of maximizing positive valences and societal benefits to foster favorable attitudes and adoption of CBDCs.
