It highlights the role of ignorance—confusion, illusion, disappearance, and misdirection—in sustaining innovation projects that primarily serve organisational reputations and donor markets rather than refugees' needs. The study critically interrogates the socio-technical and power dynamics within blockchain adoption in refugee aid, revealing how local aid workers and refugees are marginalized despite promises of empowerment.","The blockchain pilot was largely a product of 'conjuring'—a spectacle created to attract donor funding and enhance organisational reputation rather than to deliver demonstrable technological benefits to refugees. Aid workers and refugees exhibited widespread confusion and limited understanding of blockchain technology, which was strategically leveraged to promote the pilot. The purported benefits of blockchain, such as transparency, efficiency, and empowerment, were often illusions or conflated with features achievable by simpler technologies. The blockchain infrastructure reinforced existing organisational hierarchies by restricting access to data and decision-making, causing local aid workers and refugees to 'disappear' from meaningful participation. Misdirection diverted attention from negative social impacts and refugee concerns, preserving the pilot's image despite emerging problems. Ultimately, the pilot benefited innovators and private partners more than refugees or local staff, and the adoption of blockchain was justified more by its marketable image than by necessity or effectiveness.","The study provides an in-depth, ethnographically grounded analysis of a real-world blockchain pilot in a humanitarian context, filling a significant gap in empirical research on blockchain use in aid. It combines rich qualitative data from multiple stakeholders, including frontline aid workers and refugees, with critical theoretical insights on ignorance and market spectacles. The paper advances understanding of the socio-technical and political-economic dimensions of humanitarian innovation, highlighting power asymmetries and the role of ignorance in technology governance. The use of the 'conjuring' framework offers a fresh lens to interpret the complex interplay of knowledge, ignorance, and performance in aid technology adoption.","The research is focused on a single case study in Jordan, which may limit the generalisability of findings to other humanitarian contexts or blockchain projects. Access restrictions and organisational gatekeeping constrained data collection, potentially limiting perspectives from some actors, especially refugees. The study primarily relies on qualitative data and does not include quantitative assessments of the blockchain pilot's technical performance or economic impact. The anonymity of organisations and participants, while ethically necessary, may reduce transparency about specific institutional dynamics.","The findings caution humanitarian organisations, donors, and technology developers about the risks of adopting complex technologies like blockchain without sufficient understanding, contextual adaptation, or consideration of social impacts.
