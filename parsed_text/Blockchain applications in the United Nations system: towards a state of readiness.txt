Executive summary 
 Blockchain applications in the United Nations system: 
towards a state of readiness 
 
Blockchain in the context of digital transformation 
 
Blockchain is among the extending technologies whose fusion and interaction across 
the physical, digital and biological systems define the profile of the fourth industrial 
revolution. Even if the technology is still young, given its potential impact, weighing the 
trade-offs and determining regulatory action and operational frameworks should be a 
subject for multi-stakeholder dialogue, including in the United Nations system. 
 
In its first years (2008–2013), blockchain was perceived as one of the most 
promising digital technologies, despite its relatively modest essence (a shared ledger of 
data). Blockchain has been proclaimed by some as the greatest innovation since the advent 
of the Internet, even though it builds on previously existing technologies (cryptographic 
techniques, peer-to-peer networking, consensus protocols) by combining them together in a 
very innovative way. The proponents of the technology claimed that it would disrupt every 
industry and would have a massive impact on the lives of individuals. The erosion of 
general trust in institutions generated in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis only 
added to the power of attraction of bitcoin as the first major use of blockchain. 
 
The popularity of blockchain has seen a historic rise and a considerable fall, with 
little evidence of significant impact beyond the controversial history of bitcoin, the original 
blockchain application. The high rate of failures of start-ups proved that engaging in 
blockchain without careful consideration of the associated risks could be detrimental to the 
concrete objectives of private companies or public organizations. The emergence of new 
platforms after 2013, in particular Ethereum, opened new paths for blockchain applications, 
including smart contracts. 
 
At present, the hype is over, and the time has come for blockchain to move towards 
business-ready solutions and proven results. The technology is still in its infancy but is 
gradually maturing. The evangelists of blockchain, who prevailed in the debate over 
blockchain in the early years of its development, have made way to providers of business 
solutions. The users and the theorists have come to realize that blockchain is neither an end 
in itself, nor a panacea for unsolved problems. Investments in the technology increase and 
so does the diversity of the blockchain landscape. 
 
According to a recent study, while blockchain was once classified as a technology 
experiment, it has made the leap from the theoretical to the practical and is increasingly 
recognized as a true agent of change. More leaders now see blockchain as integral to 
organizational innovation. They are investing resources in blockchain as a strategic solution 
in more tangible ways (see, for example, “Deloitte’s 2020 global blockchain survey: From 
promise to reality”). In the same vein, another study estimates that blockchain technology 
has the potential to boost global gross domestic product by $1.76 trillion over the next 
decade.1  
 
The United Nations system organizations could not stand aside and watch 
developments in the industry. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 
strategic calls for innovation that have followed it, have prompted some organizations to 
take the lead and experiment with blockchain applications, mostly for operational activities. 
Some organizations are contemplating visionary ideas for very ambitious applications 
based on blockchain: a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination certification 
infrastructure (a partnership between the World Health Organization and the Government

of Estonia), a unique United Nations ID (the United Nations Digital Solution Centre, 
founded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
and the World Food Programme (WFP) in collaboration with the United Nations 
International Computing Centre) and a draft governance framework for humanitarian 
assistance (issued by WFP and its partners in the “Building Blocks” project). 
 
There is considerable work in progress in the United Nations system: standards are 
being developed, legal aspects examined and blockchain pilots carried out. Ten 
organizations use blockchain applications for different types of projects and operations, 
individually and in collaboration. The ongoing use cases, most of them at field level, 
include supply chain, digital payments, tracing of livestock, digital identity and land 
registration. Most organizations that are not using blockchain now, are considering a 
possible use in the future. Their interest will grow and mature as innovation in blockchain 
accelerates.  
 
However, the resources used for blockchain are minimal and its history in the United 
Nations system is short: from 2017 to 2020. The Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) review was 
conducted with a view to looking to the future. The present report is intended to assist the 
participating organizations, in particular those willing to implement blockchain applications 
but not yet having the means, the knowledge or clear objectives to do so. In a nutshell, the 
main purpose of the report is to assemble information and a package of recommendations 
leading to a state of readiness of United Nations system organizations for making good use 
of the technology. 
 
The main dilemmas faced by JIU in its attempt to take a balanced approach to 
blockchain were, by and large, the following: 
 
(a) 
Using a language accessible to readers who are non-technical, including 
senior managers, while being accurate enough for the United Nations staff involved directly 
in the promotion or practical use of blockchains; 
 
(b) 
Moving the focus on recommendations from a traditional compliance 
perspective to a prospective focus and from too prescriptive a standpoint to a more flexible 
scenario-based approach, without prejudice to the specificity of the United Nations system; 
 
(c) Arguing for a fundamental change of attitude towards innovation, from a wait-
and-see approach (let us see what the technology would let us do) to a proactive one (let us 
see what technology could do for us); 
 
(d) 
Keeping as much as possible the balance between highlighting the potential 
benefits of blockchain (without promoting unconditional adoption of the technology) on the 
one hand and the risks and challenges involved (without discouraging innovation) on the 
other hand; 
 
(e) 
Trying to propose a specific United Nations decision-making approach to 
using blockchain, whose original concept was born with the clear underlying intention of 
circumventing central control. Such an approach is not likely to be cognizant of the values 
of the United Nations and its vocation to deliver public goods;  
 
(f) 
Demystifying the aura that surrounded the technology when it was being 
hyped and conveying the message that adopting blockchain is less a technological decision 
than a pragmatic, business-serving decision. 
 
The report contains both arguments and caveats as presented by the participating 
organizations, while the recommendations and the elements for a decision-making matrix 
are all proposed by them. 
 
The report is also intended as a contribution to the collective efforts triggered by 
recent overarching strategies on new technologies and the future of work, which address the 
issue of innovation and the use of digital technologies by the United Nations system in an 
action-oriented approach. The use of blockchain is viewed in the context of the 
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in support of the vision contained in 
the report of United Nations Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation.

Objectives 
 
The specific objectives of the JIU review of blockchain applications were to:  
 
(a) 
Map the current use of blockchain applications in the United Nations system;  
 
(b) 
Compile lessons learned during this phase of incipient development and 
identify good practices;  
 
(c) 
Identify main challenges and risks related to the use of blockchain; 
 
(d) 
Explore the potential use of blockchain to facilitate greater inter-agency 
cooperation and efficiency; 
 
(e) 
Provide inputs for developing guidance, standards and frameworks for the 
future use of blockchain applications. 
 
In chapter V and recommendation 4 below, JIU proposes a decision-making matrix, 
developed in full consideration of the specificity of the United Nations, for the rigorous 
determination of the use cases for which blockchain is really the best option compared to 
traditional alternatives. The sequence that is recommended describes a simple but 
comprehensive decision-making process, in several layers, that includes a minimalistic 
decision tree for the adoption of a blockchain solution, passing through the choice of a 
specific blockchain platform and the optimization of blockchain architecture to its 
compatibility with the Sustainable Development Goals and the safeguards of United 
Nations values. The decision-making matrix is an attempt to offer some initial system-wide 
guidance as a response to the needs formulated by many United Nations system 
organizations. 
 
Main findings 
 
There is an increasing interest in the United Nations system in the use of 
blockchain applications, including among organizations that are not contemplating an 
immediate adoption of the technology. Several organizations took the lead in experimenting 
with blockchain projects and can provide the system with valuable lessons learned and 
some promising practices. The caution, where it exists, is fueled by a number of different 
issues, including a lack of knowledge of the technology, a lack of resources to engage in 
pilot projects and a lack of awareness of the specific problems to be solved using 
blockchain.  
 
The ongoing blockchain applications do not offer a critical mass, quantitatively and 
qualitatively, to demonstrate the usability and relevance of blockchain in its specific core 
features. Some assumptions are not confirmed yet; characteristics such as immutability and 
decentralization need more testing. The experience accumulated so far is still 
inconclusive as to a possible massive use beyond financial services. 
 
Some of the core features of blockchain, such as anonymity, as present in some 
cases of blockchain applications, or the individual control of private keys, appear to be 
incompatible with some of the areas of interest for United Nations system organizations, in 
particular in the humanitarian domain. Awareness among current and potential users of the 
new risks brought about by blockchain is increasing and compromise solutions are being 
sought, possibly contradicting popular assumptions about blockchain. 
 
 
While rigid regulation of blockchain at too early a stage may still be 
counterproductive, minimum policies and standards are expected by both users and 
solution providers in order to reduce legal uncertainty and encourage innovation. 
 
The views on the need of in-house technical expertise may diverge, but most 
participating organizations consider that building such expertise is useful and realistic. The 
creative use of open-source blockchain solutions is feasible and can reduce vendor lock-in 
and other forms of excessive dependence on the market. 
 
Blockchain, by virtue of its network vocation, carries unprecedented opportunities 
for inter-agency collaboration, while working in silos will be a recipe for a waste of 

--- Page 8 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
vi 
resources, duplication, lack of coherence and blind dependence on commercial terms.  
 
Partnerships with other stakeholders can take new forms, but the trust and 
reputation aspects need to stick to the existing rules. 
 
Blockchain implies a need for culture change at the level of inter-agency 
collaboration: for example, acceptance of the role of leading organizations or coalitions of 
the willing as a driving force in innovation efforts; encouraging collective engagements in 
using blockchain in support of the Sustainable Development Goals; joint investment in 
blockchain projects; and incentivizing cooperation. Member States do not promote inter-
agency cooperation enough in practical terms and continue to fund individual projects in 
individual organizations with similar objectives, rather than conditioning such findings on 
collective work. 
 
Against that background, one of the most optimistic findings of the present review is 
that the first years of blockchain practice in the United Nations system confirm already a 
healthy emerging tendency towards inter-agency cooperation. The most significant 
ongoing projects are already being undertaken by two or more organizations and are open 
to other willing organizations, while standards with a system-wide potential are 
developed with multiple inputs. Even pilot projects developed at country level have an 
in-built vocation of openness and inclusion, as illustrated in the present report. 
 
The report is an attempt to encourage a new silo-breaking and collaborative 
approach that blockchain technology allows and supports. A real state of readiness in 
using blockchains, if and when needed, should be irreversibly built on inter-agency 
cooperation. 
* * * 
 
Recommendations 
 
The report includes eight formal recommendations in which JIU proposes guidance 
for future action aimed at solving the problems identified during the review, including on 
the integration of blockchain use into the overall innovation strategies and policies; 
knowledge sharing and capacity building; system-wide action and role playing; risk 
management. Another key recommendation describes a decision-making matrix for the 
determination of an adequate business case. 
 
The recommendations are addressed to the governing bodies of the United Nations 
system organizations (2), the Secretary-General of the United Nations (1), and the 
executive heads of the United Nations system organizations (5). 
 
Recommendation 1 
 
The governing bodies of the United Nations system organizations should ensure 
that, when applicable, the use of blockchain applications will be integrated, together 
with other digital technologies, into the innovation strategies and policies adopted by 
their respective organizations. 
 
Recommendation 2 
 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations should make 
sure that the examination of possible blockchain use cases will be based on 
assessments of project risks, including with respect to relevant organizational policies 
and regulations on privileges and immunities, data protection, confidentiality, 
cybersecurity, system integrity, and reputation. 
 
Recommendation 3  
 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations, if they have 
not already done so, should endorse the Principles for Digital Development by the end 
of 2022, as a first step to ensuring a general common understanding of digital

vii 
transformation at the organizational level, including the possible use of blockchains. 
 
Recommendation 4 
 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations should ensure 
that any decision on using blockchain should be based on an appropriate 
determination of the business case and of the most suitable solution, using as guidance 
a decision-making matrix (as described in the present report, as well as any enhancements 
and/or adaptations). 
 
Recommendation 5 
 
The Secretary-General, in consultation with the executive heads of the United 
Nations 
system 
organizations, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
International 
Telecommunication Union, should assign, by the end of 2021, to a United Nations 
representative in charge of digital technologies and related issues, the task of following 
the development of blockchain interoperability standards and open-source projects 
aimed at blockchain interoperability, as part of an overall consideration of the policy 
implications of the technology, and to work with all organizations accordingly. 
 
Recommendation 6 
 
The governing bodies of the United Nations system organizations should 
encourage Member States to engage with the United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Law in its exploratory and preparatory work on legal issues that 
relate to blockchain in the broader context of the digital economy and digital trade, 
including on dispute resolution, which is aimed at reducing legal insecurity in that 
field. 
 
Recommendation 7 
 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations that have 
developed blockchain applications - in line with the call by the Secretary-General in 
his Roadmap for Digital Cooperation for the United Nations to deploy digital public 
goods – should follow, whenever possible, open-source principles when they develop 
software, and make available the codes to other United Nations organizations. 
 
Recommendation 8 
 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations, through the 
relevant coordination mechanisms, including with support from the United Nations 
International Computing Centre, should consider the adoption of a non-binding inter-
agency blockchain governance framework for use by interested organizations, with a 
view to ensuring coherent and consistent blockchain approaches across the system by 
the end of 2022, including for projects that may involve multiple United Nations 
organizations. 
 
The report also contains nine soft recommendations. Most of the soft 
recommendations are meant to disseminate good practices and improve blockchain 
knowledge-sharing at the system level.  
• The “Building Blocks” governance framework, if and when adopted, should be 
examined for its relevance for similar undertakings (para. 78); 
• ITU should regularly inform all organizations about the standards developed for 
digital technologies, including distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain 
(para. 256); 
• A library of information should be established on the concrete blockchain 
applications in use in the United Nations system and the progress made in their 

--- Page 10 ---

viii 
implementation (para. 140); 
• The organizations should cooperate with the UNCITRAL secretariat by providing 
documentation on their experience, the lessons learned from their use of blockchain-
supported applications and on their prospective needs from a legal standpoint (para. 
268); 
• A roster of external providers of blockchain solutions, accessible to all interested 
organizations, should be established (para. 277); 
• The creation of a United Nations digital identity should be supported (para. 298). 
 
Two further soft recommendations concern the need for blockchain solutions to be 
fully transparent and clear as to the exact roles and responsibilities of the participants (para. 
73) and be assessed in terms of efficiency, not in isolation but by the inclusion of 
management and maintenance costs on a longer perspective (para. 89). Finally, one soft 
recommendation invites organizations to consider the inclusion in the organizational 
learning curricula, where appropriate and necessary, of basic training on how blockchains 
and other digital technologies work (para. 288).

I. Introduction 
 
A. 
Background 
1. 
The Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) of the United Nations system included a review of 
blockchain applications in its programme of work for 2020. 
2. 
Based on a proposal by a JIU Inspector, the intention is to respond to the increasing 
interest of United Nations organizations, at the strategic and operational levels, in 
leveraging the efficiency gains that are attributable to a dynamic and promising digital 
technology: blockchain. 
3. 
In doing so, JIU joins the collective efforts triggered by recent overarching strategies 
on new technologies and the future of work that address the issue of innovation and the use 
of digital technologies by the United Nations system in an action-oriented approach.2 
4. 
The use of blockchain should also be viewed in the context of the achievement of 
the Sustainable Development Goals. The Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital 
Cooperation recognized that digital technologies are expected to bring a significant 
contribution to the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to cut 
across international boundaries, policy silos and professional domains.3 
5. 
The preliminary research conducted before the start of the present review, showed 
that, despite the growing interest in this technology, there is a need for more guidance 
available to the United Nations system organizations, including frameworks or 
methodologies on how and when they should consider using blockchain applications. As 
the blockchain industry is in its infancy, as is the awareness in the public sector of the 
opportunities and challenges related to such technologies, the United Nations system cannot 
just wait and see or engage its resources randomly.  
6. 
The present review gives the Inspector the opportunity to emphasize the increasing 
importance of, and need for engagement in, a strategic oversight that is not limited to 
reviewing present practices, but also attempts to anticipate, prevent and mitigate risks and 
foster efficient use of resources in the future, while encouraging innovation. 
 
B. 
Context 
7. 
“The Fourth Industrial Revolution creates a world in which virtual and physical 
systems of manufacturing cooperate with each other in a flexible way at the global level.”4 
As stated by the coiners of the concept, the fourth industrial revolution is not only about 
smart and connected machines and systems. It is the fusion of these technologies and their 
interaction across the physical, digital and biological domains. Blockchain is an extending 
technology that can reform the physical world, alter the human being and integrate the 
environment, together with artificial intelligence and robotics, the Internet of things, 
quantum computing, virtual and augmented realities and others. 
8. 
Blockchain is a digital distributed ledger which has an immutable characteristic. A 
ledger is a database of transactional records (data). In contrast to traditional transactional 
systems controlled by centralized authorities, such as a bank or service provider, blockchain 
technology enables the distribution of responsibility among all participating computers 
(called nodes), which share the same information, use a consensus process to validate 
transactions and monitor records collectively. Once the nodes reach a consensus on the 
validation, the transaction is written into a block, which becomes very difficult to modify or 
delete.

9. 
There are different types of blockchains, notably two main groups: public, 
permissionless blockchains; and private, permissioned blockchains. In a public blockchain, 
anyone who wishes can participate in the network, help maintain the ledger and see all the 
transactions that are taking place. In a private, permissioned blockchain, both the 
information and the maintenance of the network are restricted to a selected group of 
members. 
10. 
The key intrinsic features attributed to blockchain are its decentralized structure, 
immutability and security. In principle, those features create trust among the parties to the 
blockchain, foster cooperation, make transactions safe and secure and enhance transparency, 
among other things. On the downside, the use of blockchain technology may raise concerns 
in terms of its environmental footprint, data privacy, cybersecurity and potential misuse for 
illegal purposes. 
11. 
Besides the prominent and controversial case of bitcoin, there are various other use 
cases of blockchain technology, which include supply chain tracking, digital payments, 
transfer of assets, digital identity and land registration. Smart contracts can be used in 
streamlining internal processes, such as invoice management, vendor payments, asset 
transfers and dispute resolution. However, smart contracts will have to be integrated into 
the existing legal framework. The current focus of blockchain users and developers is on 
the identification of use cases where blockchain can make a difference. 
12. 
The international financial institutions are also examining, in an increasingly 
systematic and action-oriented manner, the potential uses of blockchain applications. In 
2017, the World Bank established a blockchain lab as an innovation hub for poverty 
reduction projects, including the development of opportunities to use blockchain and other 
disruptive technologies in areas such as land administration, supply chain management, 
health, education, cross-border payments, and carbon market trading. The International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) worked with key influencers and experts to examine the 
potential and perils of blockchain. An initial report was published in October 2017. In a 
more recent report, IFC observed that since then, additional in-depth notes had been added 
to broaden and deepen the understanding of this burgeoning technology, its enormous 
potential, and its many challenges.5 
13. 
According to the information collected by JIU, governments at the national or local 
level also use blockchain applications, while others have adopted specific blockchain 
regulations. The common denominator of those regulations and other institutional measures 
is that they consider blockchain applications not only from a technological or cost angle, 
but also from governance and social perspectives, given the inherently decentralized 
structure of blockchain. 
14. 
Blockchain is a strategic topic of considerable potential and the United Nations 
should do more to understand it and identify efficient uses enabled by this technology. 
Blockchain applications can help organizations to reduce transaction costs, enhance 
efficiency and effectiveness, lower the risk of fraud, control financial risk and protect data. 
They may also help to address operational and programmatic challenges. On the other hand, 
in view of some of its characteristics (decentralized consensus mechanisms, possible 
anonymity of users, energy imprint), some of the main features of blockchain can raise 
ethical problems, ecological concerns and legal issues.  
15. 
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the General Assembly 
emphasized the need to discuss “technology and innovation cooperation around thematic 
areas for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, congregating all 
relevant stakeholders to actively contribute in their area of expertise”.6 That cooperation 
 
 
 
5 See, for example, IFC, Blockchain: Opportunities for Private Enterprises in Emerging Markets 
(January 2019) in which IFC provides an examination of blockchain implementation in financial 
services and global supply chains; a regional analysis of blockchain developments in emerging 
markets; and a new focus on the ability of blockchain to facilitate low-carbon energy solutions, as 
well as a discussion of the legal and governance issues associated with adoption of the technology.

Sustainable Development”.

implies not only inter-agency cooperation and partnerships, but also efficient use of 
technologies. Blockchain, by its nature as a distributed technology, may be the catalyst for 
more system-wide coordination and convergence, and an enabler of a more efficient use of 
resources. 
16. 
While the advantages of using blockchain technologies in United Nations 
operational activities are assumed to be inherent and embedded in such technologies, the 
evidence that the theoretical benefits are confirmed in practice is not always available. In 
addition, some of the core characteristics of blockchain, among which are trust and 
immutability, have been challenged. In addition, some features that are valorized in the 
private sector may not fit the purpose, values and responsibilities of the United Nations 
system. While opening the door to innovation, an understanding of the potential 
implications of blockchain must therefore be continuously updated and deepened. United 
Nations staff, from Headquarters to the country level, should understand how such 
technologies are impacting their areas of work and test, in a responsible way, how 
blockchain can be leveraged to better deliver on their respective mandates.  
 
C. 
Purpose, objectives and scope 
17. 
In line with its mandate, the purpose of this JIU review is to inform and make 
recommendations to decision makers (governing bodies and executive heads) on the 
characteristics of blockchain technology from a cross-cutting perspective and bearing in 
mind the potential benefits and risks. It is expected that the assessment and analysis will 
help to bridge the knowledge gap between the decision makers in the United Nations 
system and the promoters of blockchain on the market, as well as increase awareness of and 
accountability in using blockchain technologies. 
18. 
The objectives of the review are to:  
(i) 
Map the current use of blockchain applications in the United Nations system;  
(ii) 
Compile lessons learned during this phase of incipient development and 
identify good practices;  
(iii) 
Identify the main challenges and risks related to the use of blockchain; 
(iv) 
Explore the potential use of blockchain features that may facilitate greater 
inter-agency cooperation and efficiency; 
(v) 
Provide inputs for developing guidance, standards and frameworks for the 
use of blockchain applications. 
19. 
The present review was undertaken on a system-wide basis and included all 28 JIU 
participating organizations and the United Nations International Computing Centre 
(UNICC). 
20. 
In the review, JIU explored: (a) blockchain applications that are currently and 
effectively used; (b) blockchain-related projects recently launched or under consideration; 
and (c) desirable potential uses of blockchain in the future. 
21. 
In the review, JIU also explores what use cases relevant to the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development could be supported and facilitated by blockchain applications. 
The use of blockchain for the creation of cryptocurrencies as such was not, a priori, 
intended as a focus of the review. However, some aspects related to potential uses of 
blockchain in financing United Nations mandates or in operational activities at field level, 
were considered and examined.

D. 
Key terms and definitions 
22. 
During the review, the technical literature consulted by the JIU team, offered a 
plethora of blockchain-related concepts used by practitioners and theorists of blockchain. 
While those concepts may differ more in language than in substance, the JIU team opted for 
the technical specifications produced in the United Nations system by the International 
Telecommunication Union.7 The list below is not exhaustive; it only includes concepts used 
throughout the report: 
• Blockchain: a type of distributed ledger which is composed of digitally recorded 
data arranged as a successive growing chain of blocks, with each block 
cryptographically linked and hardened against tampering and revision. 
• Block: an individual data unit of a blockchain, composed of a collection of 
transactions and a block header. 
• Block header: a data structure that includes a cryptographic link to the previous 
block. 
• Consensus: agreement that a set of transactions is valid. 
• Decentralized application: an application that runs in a distributed and 
decentralized computing environment. 
• Decentralized system: a distributed system wherein control is distributed among the 
persons or organizations participating in the operation of the system. 
• Distributed ledger: a type of ledger that is shared, replicated and synchronized in a 
distributed and decentralized manner. 
• Immutable: the property of blockchain and distributed ledger systems that ledger 
records can only be added, but not removed or modified, and are designed not to 
allow changes to historical data over time. 
• Ledger: an information store that keeps final and definitive (immutable) records of 
transactions. 
• Node: a device or process that participates in a distributed ledger network. 
• Permissioned: requiring authorization to perform a particular activity or activities. 
• Permissionless: not requiring authorization to perform any particular activity. 
• Permissioned distributed ledger system: a distributed ledger system in which 
permissions are required to maintain and operate a node. 
• Permissionless distributed ledger system: a distributed ledger system in which 
permissions are not required to maintain and operate a node. 
• Public distributed ledger system: a distributed ledger system which is accessible to 
the public for use. 
• Private distributed ledger system: a distributed ledger system which is accessible 
for use only to a limited number of users. 
• Smart contract: a program written on the distributed ledger system which encodes 
the rules for specific types of distributed ledger system transactions in a way that can 
be validated and triggered by specific conditions. 
• Token: a digital representation of value on a shared distributed ledger that is owned 
and secured using cryptography to ensure its authenticity and prevent modification 
or tampering without the owner’s consent. 
• Transaction: the whole of the exchange of information between nodes.

• Wallet: software and/or hardware used to generate, manage and store both private 
and public keys and addresses, which enable distributed ledger technology users to 
carry out transactions. Some wallets may interact with smart contracts and allow 
single and/or multi-signature. 
Note: blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, but there are other distributed ledger 
systems that are not blockchain. While the definitions above cover distributed ledger systems 
in general, they are fully valid for blockchains. In other words, distributed ledger technology 
reads also, in the selection of terms and definitions, as blockchain. 
 
E. 
Methodology 
23. 
The inclusion of the topic in the JIU programme of work was preceded by 
preliminary research and preparatory activities, such as the “Special dialogue on how can 
blockchain technology help us to finance the SDGs” (3–4 April 2018), as part of an 
international conference, organized by JIU in follow-up to a report on partnerships with the 
private sector, and the Conference on “Blockchain for impact”, co-organized by JIU and 
Geneva Macro Labs (Geneva, 26–27 September 2019), both with multi-stakeholder 
participation.  
24. 
To explore the interest of participating organizations at the operational level, the 
Inspector also attended meetings organized by other United Nations entities (SDG Lab, the 
United Nations Institute for Training and Research) and diplomatic missions (Canada and 
Switzerland) in 2018 and 2019. He also attended meetings under global auspices, such as 
the second Geneva Blockchain Congress and the World Economic Forum in Davos (2020). 
The available preliminary documentation included a report focused on the United Nations, 
produced for JIU by a Capstone research team from the Geneva Graduate Institute of 
International and Development Studies. 
25. 
The review was undertaken between February and November 2020 on a system-
wide basis. In accordance with JIU norms, standards and guidelines and its internal 
working procedures, the methodology followed in preparing the report included an 
extensive literature review, an in-depth desk review and analysis of existing policies and 
practices related to the use of blockchain technology, a corporate questionnaire and 
interviews. Data collection and analysis relied on both qualitative and quantitative methods. 
26. 
Data collection instruments included:  
 
(a) 
Questionnaires to all JIU participating organizations and the International 
Computing Centre; 
 
(b) 
Structured and semi-structured interviews with officials in the United Nations 
system;  
 
(c) 
Ad hoc brainstorming sessions and participation in meetings of blockchain 
practitioners; 
 
(d) 
Consultations with representatives of the industry and government authorities 
that have adopted specific legislation with respect to blockchain; 
 
(e) 
Dialogue and consultations with other international organizations;  
 
(f) 
Use of open sources for information and learning on blockchain, including 
online courses on the LinkedIn, edX and Coorpacademy platforms. 
27. 
The questionnaires were drafted as two options, in order to collect the views of both 
organizations that currently use blockchain and the expectations of those that do not. All 
JIU participating organizations and UNICC responded to the corporate questionnaire and 
other requests for information. In addition, 56 interviews with approximately 116 
individuals were conducted before and during the review. In-person meetings were held 
with individuals from organizations headquartered in Geneva, where possible. Online 
interviews were conducted in cases where on-site meetings were not possible, due to 
COVID-19.

28. 
The team interviewed members of staff of and benefited from presentations by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the World Economic Forum and the 
World Bank, as well as from legal experts and blockchain solution providers from 
governmental authorities, start-ups, networks and platforms, including the Office for 
Financial Market Innovation of the Principality of Liechtenstein and Crypto Valley 
Venture Capital (CV VC), Zimt, the Swiss Blockchain Federation, Bitcoin Suisse AG, 
Nägele Rechtsanwälte GmbH, Digital Assets Legal Advisors (DALAW), Old School 
GmbH, Tezos Foundation, the Geneva Internet Platform, the Swiss Blockchain Institute 
and Geneva Macro Labs. 
29. 
In its assessment, JIU was also guided, as appropriate, by the principles of a SWOT8 
analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the efficient 
use of blockchain applications in the context of the United Nations system. 
30. 
At the time of the preparation of the present report, only a limited number of entities 
had implemented or experimented with blockchain applications. Existing practices do not 
therefore represent a statistically significant quantity or a timeline long enough for a 
rigorous SWOT analysis. However, an analysis of the current blockchain applications 
offers valuable lessons learned and indicates areas of work that can be, in principle, 
supported by the technology. The other organizations indicated a keen interest in exploring 
the potential of blockchain. In the report, JIU attempts to offer guidance, raise awareness of 
blockchain in a balanced and realistic way, provide information about standardization and 
regulatory activities that are relevant in this area and, more importantly, anticipate the need 
for inter-agency cooperation. 
31. 
An internal peer review procedure was used to solicit comments from all JIU 
Inspectors (“collective wisdom”) before the report was finalized. The draft report was also 
circulated to JIU participating organizations for correction of factual errors and for 
comments on its findings, conclusions and recommendations. 
32. 
To facilitate the handling of the report, the implementation of its recommendations 
and monitoring thereof, annex IV contains a table indicating whether the report is submitted 
to the legislative bodies and executive heads of the organizations reviewed for action or for 
information. 
33. 
The Inspector wishes to express his sincere appreciation to all representatives of the 
United Nations system organizations and representatives of other organizations and entities 
who assisted in the preparation of the present report, and in particular to those who 
participated in the interviews and questionnaires and so willingly shared their knowledge 
and expertise.

II. Mapping blockchain applications in the United Nations 
system 
 
A. 
Interest in blockchain increases cautiously 
34. 
United Nations system organizations are at an early stage of blockchain 
implementation. The existing applications are used in different forms and ways and for 
different types of projects, programmes and activities.  
35. 
At the time of the preparation of the present report, 10 organizations were using 
blockchain, individually or in collaboration, and had a dedicated blockchain infrastructure 
in place. Those organizations include World Food Programme (WFP)/United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO)/International Telecommunication Unit (ITU), the 
International Computing Centre (UNICC)/United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund 
(UNJSPF), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)/United 
Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT) (all engaged 
in joint projects), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and a number of country 
offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Use cases include supply 
chain, digital payments, tracing of livestock, digital identity and land registration. 
36. 
Other organizations are considering the possible use of blockchain applications in 
the future, including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the 
United Nations Secretariat. Several organizations are engaged in research and other 
activities, such as capacity-building projects, in relation to their core area of work and 
mandate and in support of their stakeholders. Among them are the United Nations 
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). They have 
all started to consider possible uses of blockchain and they are all interested in 
understanding and knowing more about the potential benefits and related challenges that 
the technology could bring.  
37. 
A specific role is played by ITU, whose focus group on the application of distributed 
ledger technology has developed several standards and specifications of high importance 
for a coherent use of blockchain by ITU members and United Nations system 
organizations.9 
38. 
At a system-wide level, blockchain is also being looked at by the United Nations 
Innovation Network, a collaborative platform on which various agencies can share 
knowledge and advance discussions on innovation. The International Computing Centre 
offers operational assistance to concrete blockchain projects and a recently created United 
Nations Digital Solutions Centre proposes testing and implementing cutting-edge 
technology pilots, including blockchain-based pilots, that can be scaled up for use by 
multiple organizations. 
39. 
Annex I to the report provides an overview of the United Nations system 
organizations that are currently using blockchain applications. Annex II lists areas of 
interest for potential blockchain applications in the future.

B. 
Pioneering organizations take the lead, inter-agency cooperation is 
emerging 
40. 
Several organizations have been early implementers of blockchain. They are using 
ongoing blockchain applications at different stages of maturity. In doing so, they have 
paved the way for other organizations to use innovative technology, as their experiences – 
achievements, but also challenges and lessons learned – will help to build a knowledge base 
and a set of fertile practices for the use of blockchain by United Nations system 
organizations.  
41. 
The WFP “Building Blocks” is a major blockchain project in the humanitarian 
sector. Building Blocks leverages blockchain to make cash transfers faster, cheaper and 
more secure. It also creates a neutral space, 100 per cent co-owned and co-operated by its 
members, which allows various humanitarian organizations to coordinate the determination 
and delivery of assistance under common identifiers. The project currently serves 822,000 
Syrian and Rohingya refugees in Jordan and Bangladesh. Since its launch in May 2017, 
Building Blocks has transferred $150 million through 8 million transactions. In November 
2020, Building Blocks was also launched in Lebanon for inter-agency coordination of 
assistance in support of the emergency response to the Beirut blast in August 2020. 
42. 
UN-Women joined the Building Blocks platform through a pilot in June 2019 for a 
cash transfer system in the Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps for women in Jordan. UN-
Women also has a project testing blockchain-based cash transfers in the Kakuma refugee 
camp in Kenya.  
43. 
WFP also runs the “Blocks for Transport” project, which aims to improve the timely 
availability of shipping documents using blockchain technology for the supply chain and 
logistics. The project started at the procurement and transport stage of a supply chain 
corridor in Djibouti and Ethiopia. The full implementation of this project is expected for 
2021. The long-term vision is to establish a blockchain-powered, modular supply chain 
platform for the humanitarian community. 
44. 
UNDP has piloted blockchain use cases in several different areas, including 
cryptocurrencies for crowdfunding. It also has several blockchain pilots ongoing in some of 
its country offices, using blockchain for supply chain tracking, the generation/allocation of 
digital tokens and for tracking food donations. The most developed relate to improving 
traceability in sustainable supply chains.  
45. 
The UNDP country office in Ecuador has used blockchain to track commodities 
(cocoa), from the point of origin to sale in the form of chocolate bars. It has also created a 
digital token for the chocolate bar with monetary value attached. Each token can be 
redeemed for a discount on the consumer’s next purchase or returned to the original farmer 
for reinvestment in the production process.  
46. 
Figure I provides a graphic depiction of the envisioned impact of the blockchain 
project implemented by the UNDP Ecuador country office. Most data are captured on the 
blockchain, but not all. For example, invoices that are captured as attachments are not 
stored on the blockchain. “Off-chain” data is stored in a separate database, which can be 
kept at the client level or hosted with a third-party facilitator.

47. 
The UNDP country office in Serbia has developed blockchain-based tracking of 
food donations from retailers (e.g., supermarkets) to a recipient non-governmental 
organization. The intention is to extend the tracking to the full donation process: farm 
production, delivery to supermarkets, collection by food banks and donation to individuals. 
Other blockchain pilot projects in UNDP country offices (Mongolia, Republic of Moldova, 
India) have been discontinued for circumstantial reasons, other than technology. 
48. 
The flow chart in figure II illustrates the structure and process of the UNDP Serbia 
blockchain project on food donations. Every participant in the platform has its own 
blockchain account (combinations of private and public keys) and every donation or 
transaction between entities is recorded in the blockchain. In the local database there is 
information on donation details, donors and receivers. Tokens based on the weight of food 
donation are generated. Once the project is fully up and running, other retailers could be 
enabled to join.

49. 
The Serbia project uses a public blockchain as an infrastructure layer on which to 
build a custom-designed, private application for use by selected participants in the food 
donation chain. Using an existing public blockchain has reduced development time, the

investment needed and the maintenance needs of the project. For the very practical purpose 
of designing and understanding blockchain-based applications in the United Nations system, 
the Inspector found the approach adopted by UNDP Serbia interesting. Indeed, since the 
emergence of the original blockchain (Bitcoin), the underlying technology and its 
applications have continued to evolve, resulting in more capable, but also more complex, 
systems. From the technical perspective, it may be possible to dissect the modern 
blockchain networks into multiple layers. For the very practical purpose of designing and 
understanding blockchain-based applications in the United Nations system, the Inspector 
found it useful to describe a functional perspective, based on two layers, which may reduce 
the cost and complexity of the project (see box 1). 
50. 
FAO runs a project with ITU for pig farmers in Papua New Guinea, using 
blockchain technology for livestock traceability. It allows consumers to buy in confidence 
by verifying the history of their products. Before the system was implemented, consumers 
had no means of verifying such information. The implementation of the new tracking 
system is vital for establishing consumer trust and enabling farmers to expand their markets 
and earn a fair return on their investments.10 
51. 
UNICC/UNJSPF: The United Nations International Computing Centre is 
supporting the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund in the technical implementation of 
a “digital certificate of entitlement”, using blockchain and machine-learning technology. In 
the business pilot, approximately 280 WFP retirees living in 70 countries are involved in 
testing the full solution. The full use of blockchain technology could be exploited in the 
next phase, which is to provide a digital ID for the entire United Nations workforce and not 
just for retirees. 
Box 1 
Blockchain layers 
The blockchain basic layer 
This is the basic blockchain network, consisting of server nodes, connected through 
Internet, maintaining and serving a distributed ledger to the blockchain participants. 
Depending on the design of the blockchain, this layer provides the basic capability of 
verifying and recording transactions and achieving consensus among the many 
instances of the distributed ledger.  
Public blockchains may typically also have a cryptocurrency associated with their use, 
but this does not have to be a primary function of a blockchain. Many blockchains 
today also provide smart contract functionality or other extended and sometimes 
specialized functions. Users can interact directly with the basic blockchain layer using 
digital wallets as end-point applications. For example, users could send or receive 
funds using only a simple smartphone application acting as a digital wallet.

The blockchain application layer 
Blockchain platforms also offer ways to connect to external systems through 
predefined protocols and interfaces. Many modern blockchain platforms also support 
some form of programmable functionality that is stored and executed by the basic 
platform layer.11 In practical terms this means that it is possible to build sophisticated 
applications outside or on top of the underlying blockchain platform that connect to and 
use blockchain networks as a kind of infrastructure layer. Such applications can create 
and deliver completely new functionalities that are not limited by the functionality 
provided by the basic layer. 
For example, an application that can only be used by selected registered users can be 
built on top of a public blockchain that allows anonymous users to use its basic 
functionality. In such cases, the basic blockchain platform serves as a public 
infrastructure, similar to the way the Internet is used as a public infrastructure for 
creating sophisticated web applications. One such case is the UNDP Serbia project, 
which uses the Stellar public network for a “private” application. (Source: JIU) 
52. 
UN-Habitat/UN-OICT: In Afghanistan, blockchain is being used to track the 
ownership of parcels of land. As part of the “City for All” initiative, UN-Habitat and UN-
OICT are working together to build a digital registry. By leveraging blockchain technology, 
an immutable version of land records is created, which can then serve as the basis for other 
government services, such as urban planning, citizen engagement and revenue generation. 
53. 
The UNICEF Digicus project, a proof of concept, leveraged blockchain to digitize 
the agreements that UNICEF has with its implementing partners (Governments, NGOs, 
academia) in one country office (Kazakhstan) as smart contracts. The goal of the prototype 
was to develop a platform to streamline cash transfers in order to improve the transparency 
and accountability of partnerships. The platform enables streamlined verification of the 
results achieved by the partners and – by means of blockchain-based smart contracts – 
automatic release of payments, after verification and authorization. It allows all parties to 
have a common understanding of the actual stage of the project and which goals have been 
achieved and showcases how smart contracts can be used to expedite the processing of 
paperwork and payment. UNICEF is also exploring the scalability of the concept. In 
support of the blockchain activities, UNICEF has established a venture fund and a 
cryptocurrency fund (see subsequent sections). 
54. 
The Inspector welcomes the effort of the front-runners in the exploration of 
possible uses of blockchain applications in the United Nations system and the diversity 
of modalities in which innovative approaches have been taken (focus on a niche area, 
inclusion in innovation policies or multiple-use cases piloted at country levels). The 
Inspector also welcomes the inter-agency initiatives. Inter-agency collaboration not 
only valorises the vocation of blockchain to build action-oriented networks, but may 
also stimulate a new culture of cooperation, the avoidance of duplication, increased 
coherence and breaking silos in the use of blockchain applications in support of the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
 
C. 
Preliminary research and exploration of blockchain is taking place 
55. 
In the United Nations Secretariat, the Office of Information and Communications 
Technology has produced a white paper and prototypes of potential applications of 
blockchain. As a focal point within the Economic and Social Council for trade facilitation 
recommendations and electronic business standards, the United Nations Centre for Trade 
Facilitation and Electronic Business produced a white paper overview of blockchain for 
trade and a white paper on the technical application of blockchain to deliverables for the 
 
 
 
11  Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce significant support for this in 2014 through “smart 
contracts” (a concept that was previously known in computer science, but which had not been applied 
to blockchain technology).

Centre. UNCTAD has addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in several of 
its reports, publications and conferences. The work of UNCITRAL is described in section 
VI below. 
56. 
WHO is working on a global strategy for digital health to establish a more 
systematic way of leveraging digital technologies, which includes blockchain. The 
immutable nature of blockchain records provides an important data integrity characteristic 
that can be used in supply chain management for medical goods to fight counterfeit 
medications and other forms of medical fraud. In October 2020, WHO also initiated a 
landmark project based on blockchain: a COVID-19 vaccination certification infrastructure, 
as a partnership with the Government of Estonia. UNIDO has developed a methodological 
framework to assess the readiness of a commodity value chain to adopt blockchain, to be 
piloted for cocoa in Ghana.  
57. 
FAO has issued several publications addressing, among others, blockchain for 
agriculture and has examined the issue of farmers’ digital identity and data ownership on 
blockchain. UNEP has published papers on blockchain applications in the climate change 
and sustainability areas. As part of the “Climate warehouse” project, a prototype for carbon 
emission accounting undertaken in collaboration with the World Bank, research shows how 
blockchain can create peer-to-peer system designs.  
58. 
WIPO is exploring with its Member States the potential uses of the technology in 
the ecosystem of intellectual property and established a blockchain task force in 2018. The 
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is also raising awareness among its members of 
the possible use of blockchain for digital identity, travellers’ records and the traceability of 
sensitive information combined with the assurance of privacy.  
59. 
The ICAO Assembly urged its Member States with experience of facilitating the 
introduction of innovation into civil aviation to share their experience with other States.12 
One such example is the blockchain summit, co-hosted by ICAO in 2019, to explore 
innovations in blockchain technology that have the potential to support the development of 
civil aviation systems. UN-Habitat is exploring the potential uses of blockchain for 
sustainable urban development. 
60. 
ITU has produced, inter alia, definitions of key terms, descriptions of blockchain 
applications, use cases and processes, as well as a methodology to assess distributed ledger 
technology systems.  
 
D. 
Blockchain partnerships pose new challenges 
61. 
The decentralized nature of blockchain and the fact that its operation requires a 
network of participants create specific challenges that need to be addressed. In view of the 
multitude and diversity of the participants in the blockchain network, there is a need for 
clarity as to their different roles and responsibilities. While the use of blockchain can foster, 
in principle, partnerships and collaboration, a clear governance framework and 
arrangements are necessary to ensure mutual benefits and incentives for members, 
implementing partners, users and beneficiaries of the blockchain, adapted to the portfolio of 
specific projects. The following examples illustrate the complexity of some blockchain 
projects. 
62. 
The Inspector noted the relatively precise and completed illustration of partnerships 
and roles in the WFP Building Blocks project, the FAO livestock traceability project, the 
UNICC/UNJSPF digital certificate of entitlement and in several UNDP country projects he 
examined. An example of the distribution of roles in a blockchain application, is outlined in 
box 2.

The Building Blocks project includes different providers and users of registration, 
biometrics, beneficiary management, assistance delivery and reconciliation systems. Each 
member of the Building Blocks network is 100 per cent equal to every other. The 
underlying architecture of the Building Blocks can easily be adapted to other use cases such 
as digital identity and supply chain management. Its entire codebase and know-how are 
available for free to other members.

Both WFP and UN-Women manage their back-end infrastructure separately. 
Transactions initiated are validated by both WFP and UN-Women nodes on the blockchain 
network. Web application, the back-end system and smart contracts are managed separately 
by the two organizations on their own Amazon Web Services cloud hosting infrastructure.

The UNDP blockchain projects involve a variety of partners across their respective 
value chains, including technology providers (Fairchain, KrypC, Stellar Network, 
Convergence); producers and suppliers (farmers, herders, supermarkets); sustainability 
certifiers (Sustainable Fibre Alliance); and end consumers (chocolate bar purchasers, 
clothing manufacturers, food donation recipients).  
66. 
In its country pilot projects, UNDP deals directly with producers/farmers and leads 
the overall concept development and project management. Typically, UNDP has partnered 
with technology companies to serve as vendor for technical implementation. One notable 
exception is the “tech cell” team in UNDP Serbia, the in-house expertise resource that 
has developed and will run its blockchain project. 
67. 
An example of a less complex structure of a blockchain project is the 
UNJSPF/UNICC project. For the technical implementation of the ‘digital certificate of 
entitlement’, UNICC is the technology provider, acting as the system integrator in the 
project. The users of the full-technology solution are retirees from the United Nations 
system (served by the UNJSPF). The system has two parties in the chain at present. The 
success of the project may allow that, in the future, all United Nations agencies, 
programmes, and offices to participate in the creation of a United Nations unique digital ID. 
The Inspector takes note with interest of the inbuilt vocation of inclusiveness and 
expansion of the project for broader United Nations participation and recommends 
that all steps in the development of the project take into account such perspectives (see 
also paragraphs 296 and 297 below). 
68. 
For the UNICEF “Digicus” project, UNICEF Kazakhstan determined the original 
need for the platform and is the primary user. A vendor was contracted to build the platform 
prototype, which was tested by UNICEF Kazakhstan, the vendor and partners. The 
infrastructure is managed by the UNICEF Information and Communications Technology 
Division in conjunction with UNICEF Kazakhstan, the vendor and the UNICEF Venture 
Fund.17  
69. 
Organizations have engaged external service providers/vendors for the technical 
aspects of their blockchain projects and to manage the blockchain infrastructure. One 
notable exception is the “tech cell” in Serbia, as noted above. Another exception is UNICC, 
as it hosts nodes on its own servers. Blockchain nodes are on servers and computers hosted 
in the UNICC data centres – under United Nations privileges and immunities. 
70. 
Against this background the Inspector notes that partners in and parties to 
blockchain applications include outside entities in both the private and public sectors. 
Multi-stakeholder blockchain governance needs to take into consideration both the 
blockchain validation and consensus specificities and the applicable standards, rules 
and practices that generally apply to any agreements, contractual relationships and 
other types of cooperation between United Nations organizations and outside entities, 
be they private or public.  
71. 
Similarly, the Inspector notes that not all the main features of blockchain fit into the 
United Nations working environment. A governance framework for blockchain applications

17 The UNICEF Venture Fund is a pooled fund investing in early-stage, open-source, emerging 
technology with the potential to impact children on a global scale. It also provides product and 
technical assistance, support for business growth and access to a network of experts and partners. It is 
complemented by the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund, a vehicle whereby UNICEF can receive, hold 
and disburse donations of cryptocurrencies, such as ether and bitcoin. For further information, see 
annex II.

15 
and networks needs to be compatible with other applicable rules, regulations and practices 
of the United Nations system organizations (e.g., in terms of protecting privacy, 
confidentiality, etc.). 
72. 
The information provided by participating organizations indicates that, besides the 
blockchain applications, other existing databases and cloud services not based on 
blockchain, including front-end, back-end and web-based applications, are used. 
73. 
While noting that the limited experience that exists in the United Nations system 
does not allow for a rigorous picture of the use of blockchain and other databases, the 
Inspector recommends that blockchain solutions should be fully transparent and clear 
as to the exact roles and responsibilities of the participants with regard to blockchain 
applications and/or other existing databases. 
 
 
Building Blocks project governance framework: a vision for inter-agency 
collaboration on blockchain 
74. 
In view of the multi-stakeholder format of such undertakings, the Inspector 
emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of roles and responsibilities in a blockchain 
application, with all parties to and partners in the application agreeing on an adequate 
governance framework. From this perspective, the most complex illustration is the draft 
governance framework of the Building Blocks project.  
75. 
In addition to its solitary presence in the United Nations blockchain landscape and 
its complexity, the projected governance framework of the Building Blocks project is an 
ambitious attempt to be robust, neutral, decentralized, flexible and attractive for inter-
agency collaboration. If it is taken up by both WFP and UN-Women, the governance 
framework will have an inbuilt vocation to make Building Blocks a multi-organization, 
multi-modality, equally owned and jointly operated network for humanitarian operations. 
76. 
The Building Blocks draft governance framework is also an attempt to reflect a 
modular approach, where specialized systems (registration, biometrics, entitlements, 
delivery, reconciliation, reporting and analytics) are integrated into a collective whole. 
77. 
The framework is intended to formalize aspects, such as membership criteria, 
onboarding or offboarding of members, data protection and privacy, network maintenance 
and dispute resolution. Its main provisions are set out in the following sections, which may 
have general relevance for other complex projects: 
• Core principles 
• Organizational 
structure 
(membership, 
governance 
committee, 
technical 
committee, product team) 
• On-chain 
governance 
(consensus 
algorithm, 
nodes, 
members, 
network 
maintenance, security and risk management, technical standards) 
• Off-chain governance (ownership, voting rights and procedures, dispute resolution, 
member eligibility criteria). 
78. 
The Inspector recommends that the interested participating organizations 
examine the governance framework of the Building Blocks project, if and when 
adopted, and its relevance for similar undertakings, in view of its openness to new 
members joining the blockchain project and scaling it up (see also para. 298). 
 
E. 
Multi-stakeholder blockchain projects can attract multiple financing 
sources 
79. 
Adequate funding of blockchain projects needs to be available throughout the life 
cycle of the project. Only basic information on funding has been available for the present 
review. That is not surprising as blockchain use is very recent and the management and 
maintenance costs for blockchain projects are difficult to assess at this stage. 

--- Page 30 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
16 
80. 
While the data collected is neither comprehensive nor exclusive, as the volume of 
actual blockchain-based projects is still low, the Inspector was able to outline the main 
sources of funds, which reflect the diversity of projects and their participants. Two patterns 
became apparent: (a) blockchain projects are funded from multiple sources, including 
external parties and (b) seed funding and other support may come from innovation units or 
similar. 
81. 
Blockchain projects are funded from different sources, including: (a) the regular 
budget, both from internal sources for regular programme activities and seed funding from 
special units, such as innovation units; (b) public-private partnerships; (c) other donors; and 
(d) international institutions. In many cases, there are multiple funding sources and several 
pilots are jointly funded by two or more entities.  
82. 
Funding sources may differ, depending on the stage of the blockchain project: for 
example, testing and development would be supported by special funds, such as innovation 
units, while implementation and roll-out would be funded from programme resources.  
83. 
For instance, for the Building Blocks project, UN-Women used seed funding from 
an Innovation Norway grant, with co-financing from the budget of a UN-Women country 
office, while staff time was made available by internal units. For WFP, funding came from 
its Innovation Accelerator and regular internal resources. 
84. 
The blockchain initiatives taken by UNICEF have been financed from its Venture 
Fund, which was created to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source solutions that have 
been developed in programme countries. Donors include private sources, such as 
companies and foundations, public (governmental) sources and the resources of country 
offices.  
85. 
At FAO, blockchain projects are currently financed through regular programme 
resources, seed money and extrabudgetary funds from the European Union. The ITU/FAO 
project in Papua New Guinea is an example where the national partner was part of the 
project and contributed financially.  
86. 
In the case of UNDP, some of its blockchain projects have received internal 
resources, such as from the UNDP country investment facilities (for example, Ecuador), 
while others have relied on private sector partnerships (e.g., the Serbia example is 86 per 
cent funded by the private sector supermarket partner and 14 per cent by UNDP Serbia). 
87. 
The Inspector believes that the use of seed money from innovation units to fund 
pilot projects (WFP, UNIDO, UNICEF, UN-Women) is a good practice, not only 
because they can provide support to country-level initiatives, but also for assuring the 
coherence and synergy of all such initiatives. 
88. 
The Inspector recalls that funding is to be considered as a whole, to ensure the 
coherence of the entire life cycle of the project. There may be specific needs for 
preliminary investment (or seed funding) for development, piloting and testing. In that 
respect, the role of internal innovation units, where they exist, is important in collecting 
evidence on how the blockchain technology has led or not to positive results, including 
cost-efficiency and increased effectiveness. The Inspector notes that assessments of the 
financial sustainability of pilot projects should go beyond the projects themselves and 
examine the perspective of scalability.  
89. 
The participating organizations could not provide JIU with enough data and 
benchmarks to assess the direct and post-contract costs of the management and 
maintenance of blockchain projects as a distinct category. The Inspector recommends 
that the efficiency of blockchain applications should not be assessed in isolation but 
include management and maintenance costs, as well as other resource implications, on 
a longer perspective. 
90. 
In theory, blockchain is attributed considerable potential for supporting innovative 
financing. The views of participating organizations in this respect were also sought by the 
review team. Not surprisingly the feedback was rather limited. Only three organizations 
(UNDP, UNICEF, UN-Women) provided specific examples on how blockchain technology 

--- Page 31 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
17 
has the potential to support innovative financing mechanisms, although several other 
organizations expressed an interest in such possibilities. 
91. 
The Inspector took note of the two main ways the organizations envisage supporting 
innovative mechanisms for financing for development: (a) crowdfunding using 
cryptocurrency and (b) through establishing a fund that allows acceptance and disbursement 
of cryptocurrency.  
92. 
The UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund is one such example. UNICEF reported that by 
accepting and disbursing cryptocurrency, transactions are not only transparent, but they 
happen faster with fewer intermediaries and at a low cost.  
93. 
Another example is UN-Women, which referred to the Blockchain Charity 
Foundation (Binance) that had mobilized $1.4 million in cryptocurrency donations for 
victims of the floods in western Japan in 2018. 
94. 
UNDP cited two early-stage examples (whose results were inconclusive at the time 
of the preparation of the present report):  
 
(a) 
UNDP Lebanon proposed the “cedar coin”, a digital asset that has been used 
to support cedar tree reforestation in Lebanon. For each tree planted, a cedar coin would be 
distributed to its investors and to the communities hosting the trees; 
 
(b) 
UNDP Moldova plans to experiment with the use of a “solar coin” to install 
solar panels on a large hospital. Investors would use solar coins to purchase cells in the 
panels and they could then lease these cells to local businesses to recoup the costs of 
equipment, installation and maintenance.  
95. 
UNIDO underlines the opportunity that blockchain brings to crowdfunding, when 
conventional financial mechanisms are combined with the new technical capacities brought 
by blockchain. It noted the example of the World Bank that issued the first bond created, 
allocated, transferred and managed using blockchain technology.18  
96. 
The examples set out above show that blockchain offers opportunities for 
complementing existing funding sources through crowdfunding or by accepting 
cryptocurrency donations. Besides the technical challenges, any such resource mobilization 
activities need to be in line with the resource mobilization policies and financial rules and 
regulations of the entity in question. One aspect to which due attention should be paid is the 
possible anonymity of blockchain, which needs to be appropriately addressed to ensure 
compliance with the financial rules and regulations of an organization. In addition, 
innovation efforts could also support the applicability of new technologies and/or new 
business models, as reported by WFP in relation to its Innovation Accelerator. 
 
 
Conclusions 
97. 
The diverse experiences accumulated by the participating organizations have already 
yielded a set of lessons learned and important aspects to consider when using blockchain. 
They will be covered in the following sections. 
98. 
The mapping of the blockchain landscape and its various uses shows that, despite its 
novelty, this technology does not create a new world. Blockchain adoption should not be 
seen in isolation from the existing policies and strategies that are followed by United 
Nations system organizations. One first conclusion is that the use of blockchain requires 
that not only aspects intrinsic to the technology itself are addressed, but also implies change 
management. As highlighted by several officials during interviews, the technical challenges 
are a lesser problem in implementing blockchain than the changes and reform efforts that 
come with blockchain or other vectors of digital transformation. The use of blockchain 
technology should be also seen in the context of innovation, reform and digitalization. 
99. 
Several organizations have developed and issued strategies on new technologies and 
innovation in order to provide a corporate and strategic framework for implementing them, 
 
 
 
18  See www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/08/16/world-bank-issues-second-tranche-of-
blockchain-bond-via-bond-i.

18 
including by outlining the key principles, objectives and goals. One such example is the 
United Nations Secretary-General’s strategy on new technologies, in which he notes: “The 
goal of this internal strategy is to define how the United Nations system will support the use 
of these technologies to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development 
Agenda and to facilitate their alignment with the values enshrined in the UN Charter, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the norms and standards of international 
law.”19 
100. 
Ensuring a corporate, strategic and coherent approach aligned to the business needs 
and means of an organization requires an overall coherence in the implementation of all 
new technologies that allow innovation. In the same vein, existing information and 
communications technology (ICT) capacity, as well as infrastructure and human resources, 
have consequences for the adoption of blockchain.  
101. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will strengthen coherence at 
both the strategic and operational levels. 
 
Recommendation 1 
The governing bodies of the United Nations system organizations should ensure that, 
when applicable, the use of blockchain applications will be integrated, together with 
other digital technologies, into the innovation strategies and policies adopted by their 
respective organizations.

III. A critical analysis of blockchain promises 
 
A. 
Theoretical strengths and benefits of blockchain are not self-fulfilling  
 
 
Strengths and potential benefits 
102. 
In theory, there are several inherent features of blockchain which make it attractive 
for use by United Nations system organizations and which are perceived as providing 
competitive advantages over alternative solutions. As the power of attraction of the new 
technology is considerable - blockchain has been acclaimed as the Internet of the future – 
the review team questioned the participating organizations about what benefits they 
expected from it. 
103. 
Those benefits could be categorized in two groups: (a) traits or features intrinsically 
(and theoretically) attributable to blockchain technology, such as immutability and 
transparency, and (b) indirect benefits that stem from the use of blockchain technology – 
owing to its distributed nature – that generally encourage and enable increased 
collaboration among stakeholders.  
104. 
Potential benefits intrinsically engendered by the original nature of blockchain 
include:  
• Creating a single source of common information between multiple parties; 
• Creating trust between parties who traditionally would not trust one another; 
• Avoiding intermediaries; 
• Decentralizing governance; 
• Enabling immutability of information;  
• Increasing the resiliency of information because it is distributed across multiple 
nodes;  
• Increasing the transparency of information and therefore holding associated parties 
accountable;  
• Neutrality, robustness and the flexibility to accommodate various use cases with 
the same architecture; 
• Reducing coordination/reconciliation costs between multiple parties;  
• Enabling the fast transfer of assets around the world; 
• Streamlining processes using the automated logic of smart contracts; 
• Possibility of “tokenization”;  
• Scalability and the possibility of expanding the network to new nodes and users. 
105. 
The Inspector notes that the above paragraph summarizes the benefits of blockchain, 
as qualified by the participating organizations in their responses to the questionnaire. They 
are neither exhaustive, nor necessarily demonstrated in practice, compared with the 
theoretical benefits invoked by blockchain promoters. 
106. 
The same goes for the indirect benefits of blockchain, which include: (a) 
encouraging and enabling increased collaboration among stakeholders and (b) creating 
opportunities for new ways of delivering services, disbursing funds, using automation and 
cutting out middle layers and intermediaries, which can lead to cost and time savings. 
107. 
The most frequently mentioned strengths of blockchain, according to the responses 
collected by JIU, are transparency and traceability. These two features could solve the 
conventional problem of distrust in different application scenarios, such as funding, supply 
chain tracing, and digital identity. It therefore has the potential to change the fundamental 
relationships of stakeholders. 

--- Page 34 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
20 
108. 
FAO highlighted transparency and traceability as two core benefits to its livestock 
traceability system supported by blockchain. ITU, its partner in the implementation of the 
project, argues that blockchain allows farmers to make a business case on a large scale. 
109. 
UNDP also found that traceability was the key benefit of blockchains that had been 
delivered in its multiple country-level projects. For instance, the Mongolia country office 
was able to track cashmere from the time it was collected throughout the remainder of the 
value chain. Local herders found that blockchain added intangible benefits to products such 
as a “sense of pride”.20 Similarly, the Ecuador country office has been able to demonstrate 
to consumers the provenance of their chocolate bars.  
110. 
UN-Women considers that blockchain can change the fundamental relationships of 
stakeholders along the value chain and enable them to increase collaboration by creating 
new ways of delivering services, new channels for fund disbursement and smart contract 
modules to automate activities, and by cutting out the middle layers in terms of cost and 
time saving.  
111. 
UNICC labels trust-building as the biggest strength, as it provides a “bridge” 
between agencies for exchanging employee information. The previous generation of 
computing means, application programming interfaces (API) for multiple software 
applications to interact with one another and public key infrastructure (PKI) for security, 
proved to be very cumbersome to implement and maintain. With the “distributed” nature of 
the blockchain, both functions have improved. 
112. 
Other participating organizations list the key strengths of blockchain in a general 
manner, without attributing or linking it to a specific ongoing blockchain project. For 
example, UNICEF noted that blockchain creates trust between parties who would 
traditionally not trust one another, enabled by immutable information, decentralized 
governance and holding associated parties accountable. It also reduces coordination costs 
and enhances the fast transfer of assets by streamlining processes using smart contracts.  
113. 
UN-OICT indicates that the distributed nature and immutability can create trust and 
accountability, and WFP mentions neutrality, robustness and flexibility as the key strengths 
of blockchain. 
 
 
Reasons for using blockchain 
114. 
As stated by UNICEF, when looking at a business case, there are questions that need 
to be considered: (a) whether blockchain is the right fit for the problem and (b) if so, which 
type of blockchain to use. The areas for consideration of whether blockchain would be a 
good choice include: is there value in the information being public, can the information be 
publicly shared, is there an element of mistrust among parties, is there a need for central 
control of the information, do multiple parties require access to the same set of data, do all 
parties require the same level of access, would the parties trust a third party, and what is the 
level of required throughput of the system? These questions are part of a more complex 
package that should be asked to determine the real need for blockchain solutions. Such 
questions will be examined in detail in section V below. 
115. 
The organizations cite different reasons to explain the search for blockchain 
solutions over other alternative solutions (for example, web-based solutions without 
blockchain, databases, traditional paper-based processes and cloud-hosted solutions). They 
do indeed correspond to the inherent strengths and opportunities that blockchain technology 
offers in principle, notably: data integrity, transparency, the potential ability to 
accommodate multiple participants or scalability, traceability, immutability, a decentralized 
structure and a reduction in the need for intermediaries. 
116. 
UNDP noted that no other technology could provide the same level of trust in data 
integrity or the ability to grow a pilot into a full-scale solution, such as adding more 
partners and adding peer-to-peer value transfer and payment mechanisms. 
 
 
 
20  The project had to be abandoned, not because of technological choice, but because of the collapse of 
the market provoked by the COVID-19 crisis.

117. 
Other aspects as to why blockchain applications were chosen included the maturity 
of the codebase or platform, the availability of fit-for-purpose platforms, the possibility of 
smart contracts and the capability to generate tokens. Some organizations estimated that no 
other technology could provide the same level of trust in data integrity or the ability to 
grow a pilot into a full-scale solution, such as adding more partners, adding peer-to-peer 
value transfer and payment mechanisms. Others, on the contrary, believe that scalability is 
problematic. 
118. 
Other reasons or assumptions play a role as well, such as cost efficiency, automation 
and an easier to operate system. These are not traits intrinsically linked to blockchain; they 
could also be achieved through alternative means. As noted by UNICEF concerning its 
Digicus application, the traditional database that was in place for UNICEF Kazakhstan was 
a costly and laborious paper-based system. The country office worked on the hypothesis 
that using blockchain would make the process cheaper, more transparent, easier to operate 
and more efficient and could be automated.  
119. 
According to UNICC, there are always several alternative technologies available, 
including other distributed ledger technologies that are under development (for example, 
cloud-based immutable databases, such as AWS Quantum Ledger) and traditional database 
solutions. All of them require the development of applications, running on top of the 
database. The single database solution approach is attractive from a cost and ownership 
point of view. The costs are likely to be lower because the development is easier, especially 
when developed and deployed in a cloud-computing context. The data ownership 
management is simpler, because there is only one owner and this is a key feature that 
blockchain claims to overcome. 
120. 
The Inspector notes that the potential strengths and benefits of blockchain 
should not be assessed in the abstract. Every potential business case is different and 
requires different technical solutions. A process of assessing and analysing various 
options against rigorous criteria or performance indicators and a cost-benefit analysis 
is needed. Section V below deals with the determination of potential use cases. 
 
B. 
Proving potential benefits: a long way to go 
121. 
According to the responses received from nine participating organizations, the 
effectiveness, efficiency and other gains depend on, and are different for, the varying uses 
and business cases. They are linked to the goals, objectives, results or impact intended to be 
achieved by the project for which blockchain solutions are used.  
122. 
In most cases, blockchain uses concern external parties and beneficiaries. In only 
two cases reported on, they aimed at internal administrative and management processes: 
UNICEF (Digicus) and UNDP (the Serbia project). In UNICEF, a Digicus pilot project is 
being implemented where the use of a blockchain-based platform in place of the traditional 
paper-based system has increased transparency and is expected to reduce processing time 
and costs and demonstrate that payments could be automated. The UNDP project expects 
efficiency gains, with blockchain helping to eliminate the manual, spreadsheet-based 
tracking of donations that is currently in use. By enhancing tracking, the developers of the 
project believe they can reduce waste and increase the amount of donated food. In both 
cases, it is too early to assess whether the benefits have been confirmed. 
123. 
In one case it was clearly stated that the effectiveness, efficiency and other gains 
were not necessarily a result of the use of blockchain applications. WFP reported that in 
Jordan, the Building Blocks project reduced banking fees by 98 per cent, resulting in 
savings of $1.5 million to date. However, these savings were from business process re-
engineering and not attributable to blockchain (i.e., they could have been achieved without 
blockchain). However, WFP estimated that blockchain did present the potential for 
effectiveness, efficiency, cost reduction, transparency, inclusion and inter-organizational 
collaboration in the longer term.  
124. 
In relation to the project implemented by its Ecuador country office, UNDP noted: 

--- Page 36 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
22 
“although some projects are still in pilot phase, the evidence so far is promising. In 
Ecuador, for example, blockchain has meant transparency in over 17,000 chocolate 
bars sold to date. By incentivizing consumers to purchase sustainable products, it 
meant 50 per cent of the product’s production value could remain in Ecuador (vs. 7 
per cent from typical chocolate bars), and farmers on-the-ground received two-times 
higher wages. Furthermore, 90 per cent of consumers chose to reinvest their 
blockchain token in planting more cocoa trees (vs. discounting a future purchase), 
strengthening the bond between consumer and producer.” 
125. 
UN-Women reports benefits related to: 
 
(a) 
Reduced costs: UN-Women no longer needs to manage cash disbursements 
in person or send cash to a bank as an intermediary;  
 
(b) 
Change of governance model: the role of banks and other intermediaries 
changed in this pilot. In addition, the data from UNHCR, WFP and UN-Women could be 
reconciled for service delivery; 
 
(c) 
Inclusion: UN-Women developed the pilot in a gender-responsive manner, 
assuming that electronic payments would improve the physical safety of women. 
126. 
FAO mentioned its livestock project in Papua New Guinea as an example of value 
created through transparency and traceability. ITU noted that the pilot did highlight the 
volume of data available to farmers and gave stakeholders access to a repository of 
information that was not available in previous historical records. However, the farmers still 
lacked the basic skills and knowledge (digital literacy) to fully utilize the information 
collected and entered to improve the current situation. While it was too early to draw 
conclusions about the level of efficiency achieved, the project attracted interest from 
farmers and stakeholders and built capacity. 
127. 
FAO further referred to another project in Côte d’Ivoire for which the “proof of 
concept”21 report stated that:  
• Blockchain has the potential to help build traceability systems that are more 
transparent, efficient and reliable; 
• The issue of cost (private blockchain) and complexity must be carefully studied to 
justify the use of such technology; 
• Blockchain is only a tool that will in no way help to solve the core issues; 
• Efforts to review and enhance the workflow, procedures and practices should be made 
first. 
128. 
The UNICC/UNJSPF project has two main effectiveness/efficiency gains as a goal. 
The immediate one is (a) the digital identity management needed by UNJSPF. The longer-
term benefit is (b) the use of digital identity for other administrative processes: 
 
(a) 
Digital identity management for the UNJSPF: in the current business process, 
the Fund processes the files of 72,000 retirees in over 195 countries using a paper-based 
form. That implies using 195 different postal services, leading to delays, the suspension of 
pension payments, etc. The blockchain platform is meant to be part of a bigger digital 
transformation and to be used as a tool to ensure that the new processes are secure and 
auditable; 
 
(b) 
The extension use case of a United Nations digital ID is expected to foster 
inter-agency cooperation and to bring efficiency gains by allowing faster movement of staff 
between agencies and increasing the interoperability of the existing management systems of 
United Nations system organizations. 
129. 
The Inspector notes that while blockchain has the potential to help build traceability 
systems that are more transparent, efficient and reliable, to demonstrate progress, the issue 
of costs and complexity must be carefully studied to justify the use of such a technology 
 
 
 
21  Proof of concept is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility, or a 
demonstration in principle with the aim of verifying that a concept or theory has practical potential.

23 
rather than other existing ones. The traditional efforts to improve processes, procedures, 
business flows, etc. need to be done anyway and cannot be replaced by blockchain (or any 
other technology) per se.  
130. 
The Inspector also notes that proof of concept processes are often led by interested 
third parties and conducted always in controlled environments.22 Caution should therefore 
accompany innovation endeavours. 
 
C. 
Not all assumptions are confirmed 
131. 
Most organizations indicated that the advantages of their blockchain applications 
had been confirmed, while not always fully. At the same time, some concerns needed to be 
resolved. However, there was little evidence that the assumptions made were the result of 
assessments conducted in comparison with alternative means. As stated by ITU, it is too 
early to draw any definitive conclusions.  
132. 
UNICEF noted that further testing was needed to confirm the decrease in transaction 
costs. The Digicus prototype confirmed an increase in transparency of information, 
improved efficiency in dealing with implementing partners, a reduction in unnecessary 
intermediaries, a shorter time spent on spot checks and also enabled the possibility of 
immediate and automatic payment. However, further testing was needed as the prototype 
used test data on a test network. 
133. 
In regard to the blockchain project implemented by its country offices, UNDP 
indicated that scaling had proved difficult for various reasons, including limited capacity. 
One lesson learned was the need for a train-the-trainers model to build capacity. 
134. 
WFP noted that neutrality, robustness and flexibility were proven in practice in the 
Building Blocks project. UN-Women stated that blockchain limited the need for 
intermediaries and that disbursements to beneficiaries were more direct, transparent and 
secure. Without the need of a trusted authority to validate transactions, the blockchain 
solution allowed actors to interact without third parties verifying transactions, by providing 
a single, agreed-upon source of truth. 
135. 
In the case of the FAO blockchain experience, the assumptions related to 
transparency and traceability were confirmed. In terms of persisting challenges, regulation 
and standardization of frameworks needed to be resolved to ensure the mainstreaming of 
solutions. Interoperability remained a key concern and the traditional issues with data 
governance (collection, storage, ownership, etc.) were still bottlenecks. They would have to 
be sorted out to extract the full benefits of blockchain implementation. 
136. 
UNICC emphasized that since they were using a fit-for-purpose platform, all their 
assumptions and requirements had been met. At the same time, one key aspect - moving the 
user wallet into a mobile application - was still a work in progress and hence no conclusion 
could yet be drawn. 
137. 
The Inspector agrees that the early stage of blockchain use in the United Nations 
system has not yet produced enough data to be statistically relevant and provide 
authoritative conclusions. While a few organizations claimed that some of the assumptions 
of benefits (notably neutrality, robustness, flexibility, traceability and elimination of 
intermediaries) were confirmed, others noted that further testing would be needed. 
138. 
The Inspector notes that attention should be paid to the prerequisite that the 
blockchain fits the intended use. As rightly highlighted (for example by UNICEF), no one 
should opt for blockchain only because of the hype associated with it, but for proven 
benefits (such as savings or higher productivity). In cases where a private blockchain 
application is chosen, it may have many similarities to a database. A private blockchain 
should therefore be designed in such a way that it takes advantage of the decentralized and

benefits”, White paper (July 2019).

24 
distributed nature of blockchain, i.e., having nodes in various locations or regions and being 
hosted on various cloud providers.  
139. 
The Inspector notes that it is essential in any experiment or choice of blockchain 
applications to compare the potential benefits and cost with the opportunities offered by 
existing alternatives. Blockchain is not an end in itself: it is a new tool whose use should 
be based on solid business cases and analyses. In view of the common values and 
interests of the United Nations system, it is important that the results of the use of 
blockchain by the United Nations system organizations is systematically shared among 
them in order for them to learn collectively and respond coherently to the needs of Member 
States. 
140. 
The Inspector recommends that the United Nations Innovation Network 
establish a library of information on the concrete blockchain applications in use in the 
United Nations system and the progress made in their implementation, as well as 
lessons learned, and that it systematically inform all United Nations system 
organizations about new developments. 
 
D. 
Immutability can backfire, decentralization needs more testing 
 
 
Immutability implications 
141. 
In principle, immutability is considered a fundamental characteristic of blockchain. 
Technically, a record on a blockchain remains immutable or unchangeable after it has been 
created. To create and record a transaction, participants or nodes running the blockchain 
protocol must come to a consensus on the validity of the transaction. After a valid 
transaction is recorded in the ledger, no participant can tamper with it. The immutability of 
the information serves as resilience and irreversibility, providing the security and integrity 
of the data. Since the data is replicated across many different locations or nodes, any 
attempt to change it in one location or node raises suspicion and is interpreted as fraudulent 
activity or as an attack on the integrity of the blockchain by other participants.23 
142. 
Immutability was cited by respondents in United Nations organizations as the main 
reason or desirable feature for adopting blockchain applications. In their view, immutability 
supports transparency and accountability and builds trust among the parties and users of the 
blockchain. 
143. 
For UNDP, immutability is a critical feature in building trust in the underlying data 
among consumers and monitoring agencies. ITU and FAO noted the same in respect of 
their joint blockchain project on tracing pig livestock in Papua New Guinea. 
144. 
UN-Women reported that the Building Blocks project (aimed at making cash 
transfer efficient, secure and transparent, while protecting beneficiary data and controlling 
financial risk) demonstrated how immutability was realized in practice on a private 
blockchain. Ledgers used in the solution ensured that the full history of and information on 
the application was available at any time.  
145. 
In relation to its Digicus prototype, UNICEF noted that the immutability of data 
increased the level of transparency as to how funds were spent. Similarly, for the start-ups 
funded by the Venture Fund, immutability allowed a new level of accountability and was a 
source of trust between multiple parties and a trigger of smart contracts. The 
Cryptocurrency Fund is meant to leverage the inherent immutability of blockchain to create 
a new level of transparency and accountability in donations. 
146. 
However, immutability should be considered with care because possible mistakes 
cannot be fixed easily, if at all. WFP, for example, highlighted that extreme diligence and 
testing is needed before code release and no sensitive information, such as names, dates of 
birth, and biometrics, should be put on the blockchain.  
 
 
 
23  There are scenarios, such as a 51 per cent attack, whereby a change to the data is forced through 
gaining control of the majority of the nodes. Such an attack is very difficult and costly, especially on a 
large network of public blockchains.  

--- Page 39 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
25 
147. 
UNHCR cautioned that immutability would only be guaranteed if the nodes were 
properly distributed among multiple entities, each undertaking periodic independent audits 
to ensure proper and secure operation in line with their respective data protection and 
information security policies. If all nodes are essentially under the control of a few 
individuals, that would create concern and would essentially contradict the core security 
and immutability characteristics of blockchains.  
148. 
The Inspector would like to point out that some of the main attributes that make 
blockchain so relevant, including immutability, are the very things that also pose a major 
challenge, in particular in the United Nations environment. The immutability of 
information on a blockchain contradicts the right to be forgotten. The transparency of 
personally identifiable information could put users at risk. 24  The Inspector invites 
interested organizations to consider that challenge in the design and optimization of 
blockchain solutions, taking into consideration the decision-making matrix proposed 
in section V. 
 
 
Implications of blockchain decentralization 
149. 
The experience that exists so far in the United Nations on the benefits of 
decentralization as another fundamental feature of blockchain is inconclusive. 
150. 
UNDP reported on how the balance between the desire for decentralization and its 
inherent complexity and the cost burden was considered in real cases. For instance, the 
Fairchain Node Network, as an external technical provider, manages the underlying 
infrastructure for the Ecuador project. Currently, they run five nodes, of which three are 
located outside Fairchain, ensuring that no single actor can modify the data. In contrast, in 
the case of the blockchain application run by the Mongolia country office, the 
administrators ultimately decided to forego some decentralization, given the nature of the 
transactions being tracked (no direct financial value was associated with them), in order to 
keep things simple and come up with more stable hosting/operating costs that could be split 
between participants in the network. 
151. 
FAO explained that in the case of the Papua New Guinea livestock project, 
decentralization gave the community a better grasp of tracking and trading in a commodity 
that was considered important. At the same time, FAO stated that the issue of cost and 
complexity must be carefully studied to justify the use of such an alternative. 
152. 
UN-Women stated that the Building Blocks project was a private blockchain 
solution that was mostly centralized in nature, but still achieved decentralization in terms of 
the architecture of the distributed ledger technology. Both WFP and UN-Women have 
separate cloud servers, which host Ethereum nodes and smart contracts, making them 
independent from each other. WFP noted that action had been taken to improve the 
robustness of the solution, including by deploying nodes in additional cloud providers. 
There is no technological solution for handling issues, such as disputes, during daily 
transactions. The Inspector notes that this lacuna is expected to be covered by the future 
Building Blocks governance framework. 
153. 
UNICC pointed out a major benefit of decentralization as a feature in the UNJSPF 
blockchain-based project, namely that other interested organizations would join the network. 
The decentralized nature of the project would make it possible to publish different types of 
“identity information” and allow that information to be consumed by other parties without 
having to focus too much on data standardization. 
154. 
The Inspector believes that trade-offs between the desired attributes of 
blockchain for given applications are possible and necessary, which will result in 
different blockchain solutions, optimized for the needs of different organizations.

E. 
Adequate digital infrastructure remains a challenge 
155. 
“Blockchain is a technology in search of a problem to solve” is one of the maxims 
that circulate in the online literature and was noted in one response to the JIU questionnaire. 
That statement has more meanings but, by and large, most participating organizations admit 
that blockchains are available and the technology is improving: the right choice of use case 
and an adequate solution are the real challenge. Most organizations use one of the two 
major existing blockchain platforms, which are described in box 4. 
Box 4 
Blockchain platforms 
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform, featuring smart contract 
functionality. It provides a decentralized, replicated, virtual machine that can execute 
scripts using an international network of public nodes. It is used to create and run 
decentralized digital applications that enable users to make agreements and conduct 
transactions directly with each other without intermediaries. Ethereum also supports 
multiple programming languages, enabling developers to build and publish smart 
contracts and distributed applications. In 2017, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was 
created, which now includes among its members partners of the United Nations 
organizations such as Mastercard, Accenture, Deloitte, Cisco Systems and ConsenSys. 
(Source: investopedia.com) 
Hyperledger is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started 
in 2015 by the Linux Foundation, with contributions from IBM, Intel and SAP Ariba, to 
support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. The 
objective of the project is to advance cross-industry collaboration by developing 
blockchains, with a particular focus on improving the performance and reliability of such 
systems. The project will integrate independent open protocols and standards by means 
of a framework for use-specific modules, including blockchains with their own 
consensus and storage routines, as well as services for identity, access control and smart 
contracts. (Source: Wikipedia) 
156. 
Organizations used the Ethereum or Hyperledger blockchain technology, and in one 
case (the UNDP application in Serbia) a Stellar protocol was used. Annex I provides more 
details for each organization. 
157. 
While the applications were mostly permissioned and private blockchain, in some 
cases they were public or a combination of the two. In most cases the organizations 
engaged vendors and service suppliers to develop and build the platform, while they acted 
as the technology partner and service provider.  
158. 
For example, the WFP Building Blocks project runs on a private, permissioned 
blockchain using the Parity Ethereum client with a proof-of-authority consensus 
algorithm. 25  The UNICC/UNJSPF project also uses a permissioned, private blockchain 
technology, based on Hyperledger Indy, which comes with its own built-in consensus 
algorithm. The FAO/ITU blockchain solution was developed on Ethereum Blockchain, 
using a public blockchain with proof-of-work consensus.26 UNDP Mongolia used a public 
Ethereum-based blockchain network for its pilot, but recommends a public view, 
permissioned write structure for any further development of the experiment. 
 
 
 
25  Proof of authority provides decision-making power to one of multiple clients on the database that 
have specific private keys allowing them to create transactions and blocks on the blockchain. See, for 
example, Mark Gates, Blockchain. Ultimate Guide to Understanding Blockchain, Bitcoin, 
Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts and the Future of Money (Wise Fox Publishing, 2017). 
 
26  Proof of work was the original consensus mechanism, which is based on a competition between 
computers (called miners) to verify transactions and certify new blocks to be added to the blockchain.

Blockchain, Copyright, @ 2017.

159. 
Only two technical infrastructure-related issues are addressed briefly in the present 
report, as they are relevant for the beneficiaries of United Nations operational activities and 
for the choice of use cases, namely connectivity and data protection. 
 
 
Connectivity problems 
160. 
The practices or views reported by the participating organizations fall largely into 
one of the following categories: 
• Projects are in the early stages or have limited pilot implementation, there is no data 
as yet about their performance in low bandwidth categories or they have not been 
tested in those conditions (United Nations Office at Geneva); 
• Some responses, for example one from (UN-OICT) focus only on the point that 
(server) nodes do not have to be located in low bandwidth environments; 
• No problems are experienced when both the (server) nodes and user points are 
located in areas with good connectivity and sufficient bandwidth (UNHCR) and 
when the end user application was designed to work asynchronously and contains 
considerable autonomous ‘logic’ built in. In other circumstances, there are no major 
problems, but that is mainly due to low data requirements or additional connectivity 
provided by the national telecom regulator.  
161. 
The main problems experienced by organizations in this respect: 
• The challenges experienced in remote sites and States that have a fully developed 
version of the application should contain comprehensive offline features (UNDP – 
Mongolia).  
• The general lack of investment into developing appropriate blockchain solutions for 
remote areas (UNICEF).  
• The fundamental challenge of verifying a digital signature online even with 
asynchronous solutions, in cases where Internet connection is interrupted 
(UNICEF). 
• The loss of transactions in cases where connection drops intermittently. To avoid 
that proper network infrastructure should be ensured for projects that depend on the 
connectivity (UN-Women). 
• The duplication of transactions when the system is not responsive due to poor 
connectivity and the need for additional work-around to overcome this problem 
(WFP). 
• The connectivity problems encountered and (partly) resolved by using the 
blockchain cloud infrastructure from Amazon AWS and IBM (the pastoralism 
experiment), while the Papua New Guinea system was designed to connect online 
and offline (FAO). 
162. 
The Inspector notes that connectivity challenges will be frequent for blockchain 
applications aimed to be used in rural, remote and other areas with poor and unreliable 
connectivity. Technical and design solutions that overcome these problems are possible in 
some cases. Such challenges must be taken into consideration at the onset. The project and 
technology design should include solutions that could work under the conditions of poor 
connectivity. To address connection drops, for example, the Building Blocks project has an 
in-built logic to automatically detect and correct transactions affected. 
163. 
If a solution is intended to be deployed in areas where there are frequent losses of 
connectivity cannot assure smooth functioning offline (asynchronous approach), then 
blockchain might not be the best approach. The cost aspects of solving the connectivity 
problems should be included in any analysis of blockchain solutions. 
 
 
Encryption, generation and storage of data 
164. 
The current practices of protection, generation and storage of data in the blockchain 
applications used by the United Nations system organizations include: 

--- Page 42 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
28 
 
(a) 
Privacy related farmers data is provided using APIs27 and is stored in off-
chain database with only references to the farmer ID in blockchain. Some data (such as 
pictures) are used on the basis of signed consent-forms (UNDP, Ecuador); 
 
(b) 
Biometric recognition (eyes) is used to identify and authenticate refugees in 
the Building Blocks system. Based on eye recognition, the implementing partner 
(IrisGuard) 28  returns a case number, which is in turn translated into a key to sign 
transactions. Each user that has created an account is issued with a set of private keys, 
which they are responsible for managing.29 The signed transactions are completed locally 
and sent to the blockchain (WFP); 
 
(c) 
Public and private keys were never exposed to the Internet or to other users 
on the platform (Digicus, UNICEF); 
 
(d) 
Identity is based on a possession of a combination of private and public 
cryptographic keys. That is achieved by establishing a trust model which boils down to 
authentication of transaction. Cryptography is provided by the key management service of 
Amazon Web Services (Building Blocks, UN-Women); 
 
(e) 
Encryption is provided through standard Node.js30 functionality based on the 
condition that end-users own and control their own private keys (Building Blocks, WFP); 
 
(f) 
Using radio-frequency identification tags and a smartphone (FAO); 
 
(g) 
Encryption and public/private keys are handled by a niche protocol, Geora31 
(ITU). 
165. 
The Inspector notes that one of the main potential advantages of blockchain 
technology is the use of cryptography to ensure the authenticity and immutability of the 
data. Public key authentication is a crucial technique supporting this objective. It is based 
on the principle that all users of an application possess a private encryption key that they 
use to sign transactions and/or assert their identity and that is not known to anyone else. 
That makes the private key a highly sensitive data asset. A loss of one’s private key would 
mean a loss of access to one’s records and assets or to services provided by the system for 
which the key grants access. 
166. 
Consequently, private access keys need to be stored safely and in a form which is 
easy to use. That is relatively easy when they are integrated in user-friendly applications on 
smartphones, but even then, it requires reliable backup and adherence to a certain protocol. 
However, in many humanitarian projects the beneficiaries are not in a position to own a 
smartphone or a computer on which to maintain their keys. According to the responses 
received by JIU, some of the practical workarounds described imply that the organizations 
should act as custodians for the private keys of beneficiaries, which are linked to the users’ 
biometric data. While that is a practical solution, as noted by UNHCR with respect to the 
Building Blocks system, it negates one of the essential properties of blockchain architecture 
in terms of decentralization and user autonomy. 
167. 
It follows that blockchain projects in the humanitarian and development context 
should consider the issue of beneficiary personal key management from the very start of the 
project and develop realistic solutions that are appropriate for the particular conditions of 
each use case. 
 
 
 
27  Application programming interfaces (APIs) are programmatic interfaces that allow applications to 
speak to each other. 
 
28 IrisGuard is a supplier of end-to-end iris recognition biometric technology. 
 
29  WFP notes that, in practice, as most people served by the project do not currently have smartphones 
and connectivity to the Internet, the members of Building Blocks act as custodians on their accounts. 
However, as devices become increasingly more affordable in the future and global Internet coverage 
expands, it is anticipated that private keys for blockchain accounts will be fully transferred to the end 
users. 
 
30  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript 
code outside a web browser. 
 
31 The Geora blockchain protocol is a distributed data layer and smart contract library built using 
Ethereum-based technology designed specifically for agriculture.

Figure III 
A SWOT summary 
 
168. 
Figure III provides an overview of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats (SWOT) associated with the use of blockchain. It is based on an analysis of the 
existing blockchain applications in place in United Nations system organizations. However, 
due to the limited data available and the incipient level of maturity of blockchain 
applications in the United Nations, the information should be considered with these 
limitations in mind, not as a result of a SWOT analysis in the strict sense, but rather as an 
indicative and not exhaustive list which provides a selection of the most relevant elements 
noted by the participating organizations.

IV. Risk management 
 
A. 
Risk management needs to be adapted to specific vulnerabilities 
169. 
Several organizations noted that blockchain was still being actively developed and 
continuously upgraded. For users and potential implementers this can mean frequent 
updates, changes in system operators, etc. In that context, UNICEF noted that, while this 
dynamic might not be challenging for a smaller, agile organization, in large organizations 
implementing changes took longer and was more complex and they might not therefore be 
able to move as fast as the industry. 
170. 
Having reviewed the weaknesses and threats listed by the organizations, it could be 
observed that many do not appear to be directly linked to blockchain technology and its 
intrinsic features, but rather to the general weaknesses and threats that implementing any 
new technology or application and modernizing existing systems will bring. For example, 
some of the inherent value-adding features of blockchain, such as the immutability and 
integrity of data, may be compromised if inadequate attention is paid to the quality and 
accuracy of the data put on the blockchain. 
171. 
For instance, FAO and ITU stress that the main weakness of blockchain is the 
quality of the data stored and the process of ensuring that the data corresponds to the 
expected quality of data (the “garbage in, garbage out” concept).32 In the case of blockchain 
applications for the supply value chain, the quality of the envisaged traceability and 
transparency depends directly on the quality of the information which goes into the 
blockchain. The authenticity or trust level of the original data entered still need to be 
ascertained. 
172. 
Another point brought up was that blockchain at an enterprise level requires a 
different set of skills and expertise than the small-scale prototypes being completed by 
smaller groups within an organization – it requires an enterprise approach. The coordination 
of UNDP country office projects is a case in point. Innovation and rapid prototyping are 
challenging to translate at an organizational level. Furthermore, the lack of local expertise 
to develop and maintain blockchain applications was considered a major challenge by ITU 
where blockchain applications were used in programme countries. 
173. 
UN-Women pointed out one of the most likely vulnerabilities associated with the 
solution originated from the point where human and machine meet. It was very important to 
input correct information. Besides, even if the solution was a fully secured application, 
exposing information to integrate with third-party applications might trigger a potential 
threat of data being compromised. The views of the organizations concerned do not 
necessarily converge on that point. UNHCR noted that there was no reason to use 
blockchains to store sensitive data under the scope of its data protection policy. It referred 
to security audits on the Building Blocks project, which had concluded that further analysis 
was needed to verify that the system was compliant with the agreed standards of 
information security. 
174. 
While not having a blockchain application in use, the United Nations Office at 
Geneva noted that if the size of the network was small and the data not well distributed, it 
would be vulnerable to attack. In large public networks, where each transaction is broadcast 
to many nodes, transactions are inefficient. Also, users still need to depend on third parties 
for the exchange of value and privacy remains difficult to implement while complying with 
national jurisdictions.  
175. 
UNIDO listed weaknesses and threats related to:  
 
(a) 
Hype: discussions focused on potential rather than shortcomings can lead to 
unrealistic expectations;  
 
 
 
32  In computer science “garbage in, garbage out” is the concept that flawed or nonsense input data 
produces nonsense output. 

--- Page 45 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
31 
 
(b) 
Scalability: technical improvements continue to offer more potential to scale 
up blockchain applications. However, three core features in particular are very difficult to 
change without significantly affecting the others: decentralization, scalability and security;  
 
(c) 
Interoperability: the lack of standardization between blockchains can be the 
source of problems related to systems integration. For example, integrating blockchains 
into financial infrastructures such as payment and settlement systems not only requires 
coordination and collaboration, but also incurs significant expense. 
176. 
The Inspector observes that several of the weaknesses and threats highlighted may 
not be specific to blockchain but rather apply to the choice and implementation of new 
technologies. Blockchain should fit the business case and have a competitive advantage 
over other alternative solutions. Small, limited pilots of applications are easier to implement 
than organization-wide systems, but the potential for scalability should be also examined. 
The Inspector emphasizes that the best way to optimize the use of blockchain, 
anticipate the related weaknesses, threats and vulnerabilities and mitigate the 
associated risks is to have a rigorously informed and documented decision-making 
process and risk assessment. The risk assessment needs to cover all risks, those directly 
linked to the intrinsic features of blockchain technology as well as those stemming from the 
use of new technologies and implementing new systems in general. Organizations need to 
be aware of the key risks in order to put appropriate mitigation measures in place. 
 
B. 
There is awareness of the risks associated with blockchain 
 
 
Key risks 
177. 
The risks brought up by organizations can be categorized into risks directly 
associated with blockchain, based on its inherent features, and risks that may occur with the 
use and implementation of any new technologies in general. 
178. 
For instance, UNICEF noted that many of the risks that apply to any traditional IT 
projects, such as lack of leadership buy-in or information security, apply to blockchain 
projects as well. Those that are more specific to blockchain projects include: 
 
(a) 
Governance of the network: for private blockchains, a clearly defined 
governance framework is required;  
 
(b) 
Lack of the required IT support to maintain projects: ensuring that there are 
both internal staff that understand the technology but also vendors who can augment staff 
capacity when needed. The staff concerned should have adequate training in the basics of 
the technology;  
 
(c) 
Handling of private keys: the appropriate key management strategy depends 
on the users of the platform; 
 
(d) 
Vulnerabilities in smart contracts: code must be properly audited and proxy 
smart contracts used to ensure that any issues can be addressed. 
179. 
WFP and UNHCR highlighted as a risk specific to blockchain the issue of private 
key custodianship that would need attention. UNHCR flagged up in this regard that key 
management is the most sensitive process and needs to be carefully implemented and 
regulated. For example, making refugees responsible for their keys is not realistic. A major 
risk is having to keep the keys centrally, if only for backup purposes. The breach of such 
keys could essentially void the security control of the blockchain. Transferring data 
ownership, for example identity data, which is usually managed centrally in traditional 
databases, into the hands of the individuals concerned is unacceptable, so technical 
remedies should be sought to mitigate such risks. In the view of UNDP, the main risk is the 
low level of scalability. For UN-Women, the cost of the new system and resistance to 
cultural change are also risk factors. 
180. 
On a more general but essential note, UNIDO referred to the risks entailed in the 
adoption of blockchain from the perspective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, a view also supported by UN-Habitat. Those risks included: 

--- Page 46 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
32 
 
(a) 
Potential inequitable distribution of the benefits: the integration of blockchain 
into development initiatives could aggravate the prevailing asymmetries among direct 
recipients. The associated technological demands, such as Internet access and access to 
appropriate hardware (for example, computers and mobile phones with minimum technical 
requirements), can be exclusionary for specific segments of a population. Similarly, 
although sensors are increasingly affordable, their cost can be a major limitation for many 
small-scale farmers and producers; 
 
(b) 
Concentration: the significance of the lopsided geographical location of 
service providers is usually not carefully considered. While some entrepreneurs in 
developing countries are already experimenting and developing blockchain applications, 
the higher concentration of blockchain companies, both in number and in capital 
investment, is mostly located in developed countries.  
 
C. 
Risk mitigation should start at the inception of a blockchain project 
181. 
Most organizations that use blockchain indicated that they had measures in place to 
mitigate blockchain-related risks, including cybersecurity and data privacy risks.  
182. 
For both the Venture Fund and the Digicus project, UNICEF has specific rules and 
standards related to cybersecurity and data privacy that are also followed for blockchain 
projects. However, it is not clear how and to what extent those rules and standards would 
address risks that are specific to blockchain in addition to general ICT risks. FAO, for 
instance, noted that it did not currently undertake specific blockchain actions, other than 
relying on its regular ICT security practices.  
183. 
The Inspector recommends that blockchain projects that are enterprise-ready 
be subject to an assessment of compliance with the ICT standards and policies of the 
organization, including those related to cybersecurity, as are all other ICT projects. 
Such assessments should include (a) verification as to whether the ICT rules and 
policies of the organization (including for cybersecurity and data privacy) also apply 
to blockchain projects; (b) ensuring that those policies and standards take into 
account risks that are specific to blockchain; and (c) exploring common United 
Nations system-wide standards, as appropriate. 
184. 
WFP noted that in the case of the Building Blocks project, it aimed to perform an 
extensive security review at least annually. That may be a good practice, but it should 
probably be based on a risk assessment to better understand the security risks, i.e., if they 
are high-level risks and need continuous or annual review. WFP further noted that the 
Building Blocks project had already undergone several reviews, including (a) an assurance 
exercise by its internal audit function in 2018; (b) a code and security review by an 
independent blockchain audit firm (in 2018 and 2019); and (c) a review of Building Blocks 
against ISO 27001 in late 2019. Moreover, WFP does not store any sensitive beneficiary 
information such as names, dates of birth or biometrics anywhere on the system. Even the 
anonymous beneficiary identifiers are hashed on the private-permissioned network. 
185. 
UNDP listed the following risk mitigation measures: (a) ensuring that privacy-
related data (e.g., a farmer’s personal information) is stored off-chain; (b) referencing only 
anonymized data sources in the blockchain; and (c) using standard tools to control customer 
interaction. 
186. 
The key steps taken by UN-Women to mitigate the risks to data include:  
 
(a) 
Applying a selective approach to entering data: the fact that the data written 
to the digital ledger is stored on a distributed system can carry significant privacy and 
security risks, without a full understanding of which data should be used on a blockchain 
network; 
 
(b) 
Validating data quality before it enters the blockchain: making sure that the 
data pulled out from other systems is of good quality. Data sets such as beneficiary 
identities and family group numbers should adhere to the standard protocol that has been 
established; 

--- Page 47 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
33 
 
(c) 
Protecting data: all the components and objects stored in the Amazon Web 
Services cloud environment strictly follow standard cloud privacy and security models. 
Data stored in the database is fully encrypted. 
187. 
Several organizations warned that following unconditionally the hype and the media 
buzz about the technology can lead to suboptimal decisions. UNIDO flagged up the risk of 
the “inappropriateness” of blockchain solutions for some use cases, stating that it would be 
essential to further inquire into the method employed for carrying out an objective 
evaluation of the suitability of blockchain vis-à-vis other more developed or cheaper 
alternatives. UN-Habitat noted that in the case of land registries, there was a high risk of 
blockchain-based systems entrenching unjust and inequitable outcomes, unless there were 
clear and enforceable measures to prevent and mitigate this. 
188. 
UNHCR emphasized that, while blockchain was considered to be robust and safe in 
terms of cybersecurity risks, such risks still existed. While blockchain applications were 
usually presented as far more secure than other technologies, that was not always true, 
particularly if they were not implemented properly. UNHCR noted that personal data must 
be fully protected throughout the whole life cycle, from capture to decommissioning and 
destruction.  
189. 
While not actually using blockchain applications, the UN-OICT, UNFPA and ICAO 
listed several potential risks and mitigating measures:  
 
(a) 
UN-OICT: misuse (wasted effort on the wrong use cases) or poor 
implementation leading to data privacy issues, security flaws, a waste of computing 
resources or data inconsistency. These could be mitigated by sufficient expertise, careful 
planning and security reviews; 
 
(b) 
UNFPA: choosing a technology that might not become standard in the future 
could lead to lock-in with providers that might not survive the maturity process of that 
business sector. A form of risk mitigation would be to closely follow the market and its 
evolution and/or to enter into a deep partnership with a provider that could lead to the 
development of a technology owned by the United Nations;  
 
(c) 
ICAO: risks of interoperability, which could be mitigated by finding the right 
balance between the need to set appropriate regulations and standards or recommended 
practices and the need not to hinder or stifle innovations through an overly cautious 
approach. 
190. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will lead to enhanced 
efficiency and effectiveness and strengthen risk management. The Inspector notes that in 
assessing risks, a distinction should be made between early exploration attempts and pilots 
(which can be tested in sandbox arrangements) on the one hand and larger scale usage on 
the other. Such an approach is needed because it is not always possible to anticipate all the 
implications of an innovation. 
 
Recommendation 2 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations should make sure that 
the examination of possible blockchain use cases will be based on assessments of 
project risks, including with respect to relevant organizational policies and 
regulations on privileges and immunities, data protection, confidentiality, 
cybersecurity, system integrity and reputation. 
191. 
Other categories of risks could be mitigated by the application of the decision-
making matrix proposed in section V below.

V. Blockchain: a solution in search of a problem? 
192. 
The Inspector believes that exploring possible uses of blockchain in the abstract, as 
determined by theoretical assumptions on its potential benefits rather than on evidence-
based arguments tested in practice, can be misleading and conducive to a waste of resources. 
193. 
This is why crucial importance should be attached to a rigorous choice of use cases. 
In that sense, the Inspector welcomes the technical report produced by the ITU-T focus 
group on application of distributed ledger technology.33 The report is based on lessons 
learned in practice from use cases that have reached the proof-of-concept stage.  
194. 
The present report offers to the United Nations organizations that are interested a 
presentation of distributed ledger technologies, including blockchain, use cases from the 
perspective of both horizontal and vertical domains and the barriers to the adoption of such 
technologies. It also includes notable connotations of their significance for the achievement 
of the Sustainable Development Goals. In annex III, JIU summarizes some interesting 
findings from ITU, which offer illustrations of one possible use of blockchain for each of 
the 17 Goals. 
195. 
The Inspector recommends reference to the ITU taxonomy of use cases, in their 
dynamics, as an initial step in the consideration of the available and realistic options 
for the use of blockchain. 
 
A. 
Applying the lessons learned, while going ahead 
196. 
The lessons drawn from the early experience of using blockchain applications 
indicate that the gains in efficiency, as suggested by the theoretically competitive 
advantages of blockchain, are not self-evident. Blockchain use is not an end in itself and its 
adoption should follow both specific business and project needs and general principles.  
197. 
The usability of blockchain applications still needs to be developed and simplified, 
in particular in terms of key management and evidence of value added. Onboarding to 
blockchain-based applications can block projects, even if the platform is good. UNICEF 
cited the example of an internal prototype of a decentralized decision-making application 
with a token-based platform. Setting up a blockchain-based wallet to interact with the 
application required an effort which was disproportionate to the benefits. Potential users 
stopped using the platform even before signing up. That is not a problem specific to the 
United Nations; it reflects the general need for increased usability and accessibility of this 
new technology. 
198. 
The low level of knowledge related to building blockchain is an obstacle to the 
effective generation of ideas, experimentation and exploration of the potential uses of 
blockchain and hackathons, even when blockchain platforms and coders are available. The 
technological component or challenges can be relatively easier to overcome than the related 
change management component. 
199. 
The initial costs, the limited data size of blocks and speed remain a deterrent for a 
significant use of blockchain. The number of use cases that are truly suitable for blockchain 
solutions is limited. Even in cases where blockchain is considered a solution, it may not 
necessarily be better than a traditional database. 
200. 
Decentralization implies the involvement of many different stakeholders dispersed 
across many locations. Dispersion of knowledge should therefore precede the use of 
blockchain solutions. In the same vein, administrative and financial capabilities, as well as 
basic infrastructure, should be available for blockchain solutions, whether designed for 
piloting or for future scaling.

201. 
Users should be able to reap the benefits of blockchain in a transparent manner. The 
added value from which end users as well as other users will benefit, should be assessed 
prior to undertaking any blockchain application-based project. Incentivizing participation is 
an essential condition for a blockchain network to be effective. 
202. 
Based on its own practical experience, FAO outlined several lessons learned that are 
worth noting.34 At the operational level, blockchain architecture should be considered in 
both on-chain and off-chain scenarios in connection with blockchain ‘oracles’.35 Moreover, 
in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness, blockchain adoption should be 
considered in conjunction with the appropriate project management methodologies that can 
speed up and help decision-making, including Agile Scrum,36 Agile Kanban,37 proof of 
concept and minimum viable product.38 
203. 
According to the same FAO source,39 and more recent analyses, the United Nations 
system needs to develop a methodology for each of the blockchain sustainability attributes 
that may be particularly relevant for supply chain applications, including agrochemicals, 
biodiversity, labour, climate, deforestation, land management, value distribution and water 
productivity. 
204. 
Several participating organizations, including UNICEF and FAO, consider that the 
nine Principles for Digital Development should be the starting point and basis of decision-
making processes on the use of blockchain. 
205. 
Above all these considerations, two major lessons learned in the practice of one 
organization have an emphatic relevance for the overall picture of the use of blockchain in 
the context of the 2030 Agenda: 
“… if we do not build openly and collaboratively and create pathways for other 
open-source projects, entrepreneurs and organizations to participate in developing 
new distributed approaches to development, we will end up replicating entrenched 
systems of control, ambiguity, and isolation.”40 
“We […] will have many failures as we begin to translate the potential, and 
limitations, of blockchains into accessible principles and practice. We must share 
our failures with the public and try not to repeat them as we build new ways to 
address some of the most pressing problems our planet faces.”41 
 
 
Conclusions 
206. 
The Inspector shares the view that the cost-efficiency aspect of blockchain 
applications should be seen in a longer-term perspective and gains should not be expected 
overnight. He encourages the use of pilots of blockchain applications in very clearly 
determined cases, containing the risks but exploring the promised benefits of a technology 
that is still in its infancy. 
207. 
Such cautious, but determined, innovation efforts will be considerably helped if the 
United Nations organizations systematically and openly share their practices, analyses and

to do, a smart contract often needs access to information from the outside world that is relevant to the 
contractual agreement in the form of electronic data, also referred to as oracles. These oracles are 
services that send and verify real world occurrences and submit this information to smart contracts,

lessons learned. The decision-making matrix elaborated below may help to anticipate 
problems and make optimal choices. 
 
B. 
There is a need for system-wide guidance on the decision-making on 
and use of blockchain applications 
208. 
Most of the representatives of organizations participating in the review agreed that, 
in addition to the effort to acquire knowledge about blockchain, system-wide guidance is 
needed, in particular for the United Nations entities that are not already experimenting with 
blockchain. 
209. 
Proposals to that effect covered a wide range of guidance tools from sharing 
knowledge and expertise to future standards. JIU has summarized the proposals as they 
evolve from soft or already available to more elaborated and institutionalized forms, as 
follows: 
• Endorsement and application of the Principles for Digital Development; 
• Access to a library of training materials; 
• General lessons learned and descriptions of various technical set-ups; 
• A library of blockchain uses and summary findings on their implementation; 
• Establishment of a pool of senior and experienced professionals on blockchain, 
available internally and externally, to which all organizations should have access; 
• A decision-making process for deciding if there is a business case for the use of 
blockchain; 
• A whole-house approach based on the establishment of guidelines and a legal 
framework governing engagement with blockchain technologies. 
Box 5 
Principles for Digital Development 
The Principles for Digital Development are a set of nine generic principles intended to 
give guidance to practitioners for the application of digital technologies to development 
programmes. It originated in a UNICEF initiative and counts over 200 participating 
organizations at present. Among them are numerous JIU participating organizations and 
other United Nations entities, including UNICEF, UNDP, WHO, WFP, ILO, UNFPA, 
UN-Habitat, UNEP, UNIDO, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
the International Computing Centre, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice 
Research Institute and the United Nations University.  
The Principles were inspired by the recognition by donors and implementing 
organizations that digital development programmes were fragmented, uncoordinated and 
siloed, and that organizations struggled to scale up or sustain them in the long term. The 
Principles include guidance for every phase of a project life cycle and they are part of an 
ongoing effort among development practitioners to share knowledge and support 
continuous learning.  
There are nine principles: (1) Design with the user. (2) Understand the existing 
ecosystem. (3) Design for scale. (4) Build for sustainability. (5) Be data driven. (6) Use 
open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. (7) Reuse and improve. (8) 
Address privacy and security. (9) Be collaborative (see www.digitalprinciples.org).  
210. 
The Inspector notes that all the proposals in paragraph 209 above are realistic and 
feasible, and open the way to a gradual but robust process for creating a coherent and 
convergent system-wide approach. To that effect, a simple but meaningful step would be 
the endorsement of the Principles for Digital Development by all United Nations system 
organizations. Adhesion to that set of principles would be a contribution to the creation of a 

--- Page 51 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
37 
new culture of digital transformation and provide a basic knowledge of the proper use of 
new technology in an institutional way. 
211. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will foster coherence and 
facilitate collaboration and a common approach to the use of blockchain and other digital 
technologies in the context of digital transformation. 
 
Recommendation 3 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations, if they have not 
already done so, should endorse the Principles for Digital Development by the end of 
2022, as a first step to ensuring a general common understanding of digital 
transformation at the organizational level, including the possible use of blockchains. 
212. 
Some of the proposals set out above have been addressed in previous sections, while 
others are reflected in the decision-making matrix for determining whether there is a 
business case for blockchain and in section VI below. 
 
C. 
A decision-making matrix 
213. 
The right choice of the use case is not only a prerequisite for a good return on 
investment, but also a way to mitigate risks and solve other problems, such as those 
identified in previous sections of the report. Blockchain has particular features that can 
provide added value compared to alternative solutions, but it is primordial to be able to 
demonstrate that the theoretical assumptions are proved in practice and that the value added 
can be proven. At the same time, it also comes with some disadvantages, as described in 
sections III and IV of the report. Furthermore, some of the virtues extolled by its champions 
might be incompatible with the values of the United Nations and with its responsibility for 
the use of public money. Blockchain needs to be the best suitable option or fit-for-purpose 
system for the use case selected. 
214. 
The Inspector proposes a matrix for the determination of the business case for the 
use of blockchain in a sequence of layers that follow (a) criteria pertaining to the core 
features of the blockchain technology; (b) other criteria to which blockchain can add value; 
(c) considerations as to the choice of specific blockchain architecture; and (d) aspects to be 
considered in the design of solutions and their respective governance arrangements. By 
following such a matrix, many of the risks and problems highlighted in previous sections 
could be anticipated and surmounted. 
 
 
Is blockchain a suitable solution to our problem? 
215. 
In table 1 several key questions are set out that should be given full consideration 
before deciding whether blockchain can indeed provide better solutions than non-
blockchain alternatives to particular operational needs. The questions are not exhaustive, 
but they are the first that need to be answered as they help the initial fundamental choice 
between blockchain and other options. The decision tree is minimalistic, but it covers the 
basic prerequisites for the choice of a blockchain solution.

Figure IV  
Is blockchain an option? 
 
216. 
Figure IV is a minimalistic and simplified representation of the decision tree as it 
results from a preliminary analysis. It should be understood in relation to the more nuanced 
conclusions indicated in table 1. 
217. 
Once it has been established that there is a convincing case for using blockchain, 
against its core features, the analysis should continue as to the value that is added by using 
it, according to an additional set of criteria. That second layer should ensure that if a 
blockchain option is possible, it also provides gains in terms of efficiency, sustainability 
and scalability compared with other means. 
 
 
Does blockchain add value? 
218. 
Table 2 indicates several criteria that are examined with respect to any projects, but 
whose relevance is particularly pregnant where technology-dependent solutions are 
envisaged.

mobile phones for hundreds of thousands of users) for 
scaling up the number of users?  
 
The responses will depend on the specificity and objectives of 
each project, but scalability, in technical and infrastructure 
terms, should be considered in the design of any blockchain 
solution 
Would there be a prohibitive cumulative cost of 
scaling up the number of transactions, users, nodes? 
Confidentiality 
 
Does personal identifiable data need to be stored in the 
blockchain? 
Yes 
Public blockchain is not an option, unless personal 
identification data are stored off-chain 
Alternatively, private, permissioned blockchain may work  
No 
In all instances of the use of blockchain, sensitive data should 
be handled in accordance with United Nations rules and 
regulations 
a  In table 2, scalability is considered under a technical angle. Scalability in terms of costs is to be 
assessed under efficiency. 
219. 
With respect to efficiency, the Inspector notes that at the current stage of its 
development, blockchain technology can be inefficient because many copies of transactions 
are sent many times over the Internet network to many nodes. However, that is a trade-off 
that was accepted by the designers of the original bitcoin and other blockchains. They 
practically assumed that the cost of sending data over the Internet was close to zero once it 
had been accessed and that redundant network traffic came at a small price for the security 
and trust achieved. Special attention should therefore be paid to the efficiency factor in both 
its technical and broader sense. 
220. 
The Inspector notes that technical performance is still a problem for some public 
blockchains of the first generation, but in recent times there are some major chains with 
considerably improved performance, able to deliver several thousand transactions per 
second and transaction (confirmation) time below five seconds.42 On private blockchains 
configured with an efficient consensus algorithm, both transactions per second and 
transaction time are much more rapid today and they might be completely satisfactory for 
any realistic United Nations use case.

D. 
Optimizing the choice 
221. 
Once the decision on the use of a blockchain solution takes shape, the third layer of 
analysis should lead to a clear vision as to which type of blockchain best fits the envisaged 
purpose. There is no one-size-fits-all consideration of the final choice and the present 
review does not venture into micromanagement. Indeed, beyond existing standards on the 
use case, there are diverse solutions that depend on specific needs and circumstances. 
However, the Inspector recommends examination of the basic properties of 
private/permissioned and public/permissionless blockchains in correlation with the possible 
implications for the use cases. Table 3 indicates several such correlations.

a  A fork is the creation of two or more different versions of distributed ledgers. 
b  For example, land records could be registered only by authorized notaries, but the general public

222. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will lead to enhanced 
efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
Recommendation 4 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations should ensure that 
any decision on using blockchain should be based on an appropriate determination of 
the business case and of the most suitable solution, using as guidance a decision-
making matrix (as described in the present report, as well as any enhancements and/or 
adaptations). 
 
 
Project design adjustments and governance issues to be considered (fourth layer) 
223. 
Once the main decisions are made as to the use of blockchain and the choice 
between permissioned, permissionless or hybrid formulas, there are a number of additional 
considerations that have to be scrutinized in the design of individual projects, which are 
prerequisites or may optimize the outcome. 
224. 
All participants, including end users, should have reliable Internet access and the 
capacity to manage their credentials securely (private keys or their equivalent). In the 
absence of such assurance, a blockchain solution would require a biometric identity 
solution or a trusted and reliable local solution/partner/intermediary, as well as other 
arrangements. 
225. 
The fundamental feature of the blockchain in its original design is to automate 
decision-making and governance (“trustless”43). By design, blockchain use implies that 
there are no disputes, as the consensus processes rule them out, and therefore no arbitrator 
or other dispute resolution mechanism is needed. However, in the practice of the United 
Nations an off-chain arbitration mechanism may be necessary, even if that contradicts the 
concept of blockchain per se. The experience of the Building Blocks project shows that 
compromises may be necessary. The validation processes should be carefully designed in 
relation to other governance arrangements. 
226. 
As the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain builds trust without institutions, the 
technology offers the possibility of turning competition into partnership, in particular when 
blockchain is used for social impact. In the words of one expert, interviewed by the team:  
“rather than evaluating competition, the priority is to identify key partners, define 
alliances, leverage from existing systems and platforms [...] for many successful 
blockchain projects encompass turning competitors into partners will allow the 
community to grow and create sustainable ecosystems for the entire market”.44 
227. 
As blockchain technologies evolve, it appears that their core benefits can only be 
achieved through collaboration with other parties in existing ecosystems or by forging new 
partnerships. According to an expert consulted by JIU, 
“blockchain can be used as a “digital notary”, as it imbues trust into transactions 
between businesses, Governments, and non-governmental organizations, protecting 
stakeholders from fraud and mismanagement”.45 
 
 
 
43  “Trustless” in blockchain means that no trust is required between transaction participants, as entries in 
the ledger are permanent and visible, with encryption technology and protocols effectively replacing 
third-party intermediaries or arbitrators.

228. 
If in the private sector the main blockchain governance problem is to make 
competitors cooperate, in the United Nations system the propensity to cooperate is assumed 
beforehand. In an ideal scenario, the United Nations system organizations should engage in 
networks of nodes, using blockchain in collaboration, in support of the Sustainable 
Development Goals. 
229. 
Blockchain consortia are, by definition, possible and desirable in the United Nations 
system. According to a recent study, there are three major emerging governance options in 
blockchain.46 Two of them are close to United Nations specificities:  
 
(a) 
The working group type: parties have equal power and contribution; 
decisions are made through consensus and members contribute resources in the pursuit of a 
shared objective. The group does not operate as a legal entity, rather each participant owns 
and operates his own node. The Building Blocks project is close to this type; 
 
(b) 
The hybrid type: a shared infrastructure operator acts as the key facilitator of 
a jointly owned operation. The UNICC/UNSJPF and the aspirational joint United Nations 
digital identity system would fall into this category. 
230. 
As noted by some participating organizations, all participants in a blockchain, 
whether they individually pursue a shared objective on an equal basis or accept a facilitator 
in a jointly owned operation, have to be motivated and incentivized. The motivation and 
incentivization should come with the good choice of a business case and, among others, 
achieve savings in resources and gains in efficiency. 
 
 
Compatibility with the Sustainable Development Goals: a crucial criterion 
231. 
It goes without saying that more important than all the technical criteria for 
assessing the applicability of blockchain solutions is compatibility with the Sustainable 
Development Goals. For example, validation protocols that would imply a high level of 
energy consumption (such as proof of work) and other negative consequences for the 
environment, are not legitimate options. 
232. 
The anonymity of the participants, which may be an advantage in some blockchain 
applications, may be sharply incompatible with the practices of the United Nations. 
Anonymity and lack of accountability can be seen, by all accounts, as major limitation 
factors for the use of blockchain. Participants in United Nations projects should be known, 
trustworthy and vetted. Alternatively, when unavoidable, the level of anonymity and 
accountability should be defined to the maximum extent possible. 
233. 
Blockchain triggers a delegation of power by virtue of its automation mechanisms, 
which may save time and resources. However, the values embodied in the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development, including ethical and human rights considerations, cannot be 
compromised. On the contrary, the first objective of any blockchain use should be to 
support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with full respect 
for its values.

VI. Ways forward 
 
A. 
Rigid regulation of blockchain might be premature but minimum 
policies and standards are needed 
234. 
The views of the JIU participating organizations on the need for regulations 
applicable to the use of blockchain are quite diverse and do not necessarily converge on 
which issues need regulation and to what extent. However, the underlying reasons for the 
diversity of standpoints reflect the specific reality of blockchains on the one hand and the 
challenges related to the dynamic environment of digital technologies in general on the 
other. 
235. 
The problems of a legal nature reported by the organizations, which relate to the 
specific technical features of blockchain are: 
 
(a) 
The decentralized nature of distributed ledger technologies;  
 
 
(b) 
The “trustless” computing paradigm of blockchain; 
 
(c) 
The contradictory relationship between transparency and privacy;  
 
 
(d) 
The absence of a central authority (for a public blockchain), with its 
corollary that there is no ultimate accountability for the data; 
 
(e) 
The risk of irreversible actions, such as losing one’s private key credentials; 
 
(f) 
The diversity of consensus or validation mechanisms; 
 
(g) 
The difficulty of determining liability for faulty smart contracts and legal 
responsibility in general; 
 
(h) 
The risk of hosting illegal activities when the users are anonymous; 
 
(i) 
The protection of privacy and identity. 
236. 
The second category consists of problems that are also valid for other current areas 
of digital transformation (cloud computing, communication on social media, artificial 
intelligence, etc.). They include: 
 
(a) 
The disconnect between the pace of technology and regulations, as digital 
technologies tend to develop faster than the regulations or social structures governing them; 
 
(b) 
The difficulty of establishing rules in view of the continuous blurring of the 
boundaries between markets and sectors, users and producers, vendors and distributors; 
 
(c) 
The difficulty of apportioning and attributing responsibility for damage or 
harm caused by using technology; 
 
(d) 
The difficulty of enforcing intellectual property rights and data privacy; 
 
(e) 
The transversal challenges raised by digitalization when technologies can 
span multiple regulatory regimes;  
 
(f) 
The intensity of cross-border flows and transactions; 
 
(g) 
The different perceptions of the protection against or resilience to cyber 
threats; 
 
(h) 
The need to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations and 
the specialized agencies.  
237. 
For all these reasons, most respondents acknowledged that it was too early to impose 
a rigid legal framework on a technology that was subject to dynamic evolution. However, 
there is an emerging consensus that soft rules and regulations are needed, at least in the 
United Nations system. They should not inhibit innovation but offer some basic safeguards 
and common standards, which can then be gradually refined and updated. The proposals 
and opinions put forward by the participating organizations together provide a coherent list 
of basic assumptions and actions. 

--- Page 59 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
45 
238. 
One such assumption is the case-by-case approach to the possible use of blockchain, 
based on the rigorous determination of a business case. Analytical tools are needed to limit 
the “hype” effect on technological investment, which may lead to operational challenges 
(UNFPA). The need for rules depends on the blockchain applications employed and should 
be considered on a case-by-case basis (UNICEF). The regulatory approach may also differ 
between a public and a private blockchain or in a permissioned and a permissionless 
blockchain (UN-Women and UNICEF). Cryptocurrencies, identity and the supply chain 
may need different regulations, beyond commonalities (WFP).  
239. 
Having considered the differences and specificities of the various blockchain use 
cases, there are generic features and commonalities for all blockchain applications. The 
review identified, among others, the following areas that might need rules, policies and 
standards, which also would support interoperability, common standards and inter-agency 
cooperation: 
• The standardization of blockchain architecture which would allow and stimulate 
collaboration and pooling of expertise (UN-OICT); 
• Risk assessment policies with respect to partners (reputation, technical capabilities, 
resilience), security and operational risks (including the lock-in effect) (UNFPA and 
UNIDO); 
• The existing support for the collection of data (quality, frequency) and providing an 
ethical approach to big data (FAO); 
• Providing rigorous code audit and code publishing procedures (UNICEF); 
• Ensuring interoperability between various distributed ledger technology applications 
(FAO); 
• Using and improving the clarity of blockchain-related terminology (UNIDO). 
240. 
The United Nations Secretariat signaled that in the potential use of blockchain, the 
organizations should carefully consider how the new technology would operate within the 
current legal framework, including the financial and administrative rules. The organizations 
must take into account the status, privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations 
and the specialized agencies. In considering blockchain solutions, they must ensure that 
appropriate safeguards are in place for the protection of personal and organizational data. 
241. 
The Inspector emphasizes the importance of a carefully considered balance and fine-
tuning between the need for minimum rules and standards and the importance of not 
inhibiting innovative applications of blockchain. In relation to this dilemma, the Inspector 
shares the remark made by UNIDO: 
“On the one hand, the lack of regulation limits the capacity of Governments to cope 
with fraud, local regulatory compliance evasion, financing of illicit activities, scams 
and Ponzi schemes. On the other hand, it hinders technology adoption and 
innovation, especially affecting entrepreneurs and start-ups which are often 
confronted with the uncertainty of incurring a legal problem.” 
 
B. 
Standards and legal framework: work in progress 
242. 
The Inspector notes that among the risks associated with the use of blockchains by 
the participating organizations, two have special importance from a system-wide 
perspective, which are the focus of the present report: interoperability and standardization. 
243. 
Interoperability is a factor that underlies and makes collaboration possible. It is the 
ability of two or more systems or applications to exchange information and to mutually use 
the information that has been exchanged.47 The distributed nature of blockchain adds to the 
complexity of this factor. For blockchain platforms, interoperability implies that 
 
 
 
47 See www.iso.org/standard/73771.html for fundamental terminology for blockchain and distributed 
ledger technologies. 

--- Page 60 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
46 
“transactions involving parties or assets that belong to different blockchain platforms can 
be executed as if they belong to the same blockchain platform”.48 
244. 
Furthermore, the United Nations organizations should not have their options for 
external cooperation limited by one blockchain platform but foresee scalable solutions that 
can grow both within the United Nations system and for external partners. 
245. 
According to the same source, a comprehensive interoperability framework should 
be examined at three levels: business model (which includes the governance model, data 
standardization and the legal framework; (b) the platform, which includes the consensus 
mechanism, smart contracts, authentication and authorization; and (c) the infrastructure. 
246. 
In this context, a few findings about standards and legal framework are necessary, as 
they are crucial from a United Nations standpoint. The business model dilemmas are 
considered above, in section V. 
 
 
Standards are being developed - more awareness of them and participation is needed 
247. 
Against the overall perception that resulted from the responses to the JIU 
questionnaire, the Inspector notes that in fact some standards have already been produced 
and there are numerous initiatives aimed at developing standards at industry, governmental 
or intergovernmental level. Among many others, the British Standards Institution works on 
blockchain standards for supply chains and the National Institute for Standards and 
Technology of the United States of America works on blockchain-based identity 
management systems. The European Blockchain Partnership aims to establish a European 
blockchain services infrastructure to support the delivery of cross-border digital public 
services. 
248. 
It appears that problems may arise from the disorderly development of emerging 
national or international standards rather than from their absence. The Inspector therefore 
believes that for governance-related standards, special attention should be paid to the work 
of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
249. 
At the time of the review, ISO was working on several standards on topics under 
ISO/TC 307, Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. Three such standards were 
already published and available: Overview of and interactions between smart contracts in 
blockchain and distributed ledger technology systems (2019);49 Privacy and personally 
identifiable information protection considerations (2020);50 vocabulary (2020);51 Security 
management of digital asset custodians (2020).52 
250. 
Other standards are under development, among which: Guidelines for governance; 
Use cases; legally binding smart contracts; taxonomy and ontology; overview of existing 
DLT systems for identity management; overview of smart contract security good practice 
and issues; data flow model for blockchain and DLT use cases; identifiers of subjects and 
objects for the design of blockchain systems.53 Box 6 illustrates an example of legal and 
practical challenges in relation to smart contracts, from a national law perspective. 
Box 6  
Smart contracts v. traditional contracts: legal and practical challenges 
Legal issues: 
• Judicial enforcement: as smart contracts are self-enforcing, judicial enforcement 
is not necessary. The nature of smart contracts challenges judicial enforcement 
mechanisms and presents difficulties in relation to whether a court has 
jurisdiction and over what specifically it can exercise that jurisdiction.

47 
Nevertheless, if a smart contract violates applicable laws to the detriment of one 
of the parties, legal remedies may be sought before the competent courts. 
• Coding errors: the questions are whether the court has jurisdiction and how it can 
interpret the intent and position of the parties in relation to the code. 
• The decentralized and anonymous nature of blockchain technology: if a court 
identifies damages that must be compensated, it may be unable to enforce this, 
due to the anonymity of a party. 
Practical considerations  
• The accuracy of the code: the code must reflect the will of the parties. The 
parties to a contract may want confirmation of this assumption. 
• The interpretation of a smart contract: as this essentially involves the 
interpretation of programming language, it is important to define the extent to 
which smart contract code can be used for interpretation. 
• The immutable nature of blockchain technology: traditional contracts are often 
modified and in the case of general terms and conditions, parties can withdraw 
from a contract. Smart contracts should allow enough flexibility for 
modification.

251. 
The Inspector recommends that the existing ISO standards be examined as 
part of the preparation and planning for blockchain applications. He also 
recommends the participation of representatives of the United Nations system, when 
possible and as appropriate, in the working groups of ISO that develop relevant 
standards. Those who participate should inform all interested organizations on the status 
of the standards and their updates. Such an approach will help the organizations to mitigate 
risks, prevent problems and anticipate solutions. It will allow the United Nations system 
organizations to bring into the process a United Nations perspective and specificity. It will 
reduce duplication, save human and financial resources, improve coherence in the United 
Nations system and enable inter-agency cooperation. 
252. 
A special role in the development of standards is played by the Telecommunication 
Standardization Sector of ITU. Between May 2017 and July 2019, the ITU-T focus group 
on application of distributed ledger technologies produced five technical reports (on 
overview, concepts, ecosystem; standardization landscape; use cases; regulatory framework; 
and distributed ledger technology outlook) and three technical specifications (terms and 
definitions; reference architecture; and assessment criteria for platforms).54 
253. 
The Inspector notes that the standards developed by ITU have the legitimacy of an 
intergovernmental organization where Member States are represented by both national 
telecommunication regulators and private sector experts. Moreover, in developing those 
standards, ITU took into consideration the ISO standards and is involved in the working 
groups of the latter. 
254. 
However, the analysis of the responses provided by the participating organizations 
show little awareness of the standards developed by ITU. There is a tendency to seek 
resources elsewhere, rather than in the United Nations system. 
255. 
The Inspector recommends that all United Nations system organizations start 
their evaluation of the potential use of blockchain applications by considering the 
relevant ITU technical reports. He recommends that ITU regularly inform all United 
Nations system organizations, through the mechanisms of the United Nations System 
Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), about the standards developed for 
digital technologies, distributed ledger technologies, blockchain included.

256. 
In both the responses to the JIU questionnaire and the interviews that were carried 
out as part of the review, the need for interoperability was manifestly one essential 
prerequisite for the facilitation of inter-agency cooperation. The efforts made within the 
United Nations system in the direction of developing standards and interoperability should 
be corroborated with a good knowledge of the dynamics of the blockchain platforms 
developed by the industry. It might be also advisable for the legal networks to collaborate 
in such efforts, with a view to addressing the legal issues related to blockchain. 
257. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will lead to the dissemination 
of good practices, elimination of duplications and saving resources. 
 
Recommendation 5 
The Secretary-General, in consultation with the executive heads of the United Nations 
system organizations, with support from the International Telecommunication Union, 
should assign, by the end of 2021, to a United Nations representative in charge of 
digital technologies and related issues, the task of following the development of 
blockchain interoperability standards and open-source projects aimed at blockchain 
interoperability, as part of an overall consideration of the policy implications of the 
technology, and to work with all organizations accordingly. 
 
 
Work on legal issues has already started in the United Nations system 
258. 
As in the case of standards, the Inspector found that the work done by the United 
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) 55 on the legal aspects 
relevant to blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies is not well known among 
many of the United Nations system organizations. As some JIU participating organizations 
suggested that the United Nations should initiate actions for “the establishment of an 
international regulatory framework” or convene “negotiations on the smart contracts”, the 
reference to the work of UNCITRAL in the present report became imperative. 
259. 
The Inspector notes that the General Assembly of the United Nations recently 
endorsed the initiatives of UNCITRAL, 
“as the core legal body within the United Nations system in the field of international 
trade law, aimed at increasing coordination of, and cooperation on legal activities of 
international and regional organizations active in the field of international trade law, 
including on legal issues relating to the digital economy”.56 
260. 
A 2020 report57 published by the UNCITRAL secretariat contains already legal 
analysis that is relevant for blockchain and blockchain-based applications, based on its 
exploratory work. It contains confirmations or preliminary answers to legal challenges 
signaled by some United Nations organizations and converges with the expectations as to 
the role of the law: 
 
(a) 
The law can create certainty in the digital economy and predictability in 
commercial transactions, which means reduced risk and costs; 
 
(b) 
The law can foster the use and development of the tools of the digital 
economy, such as data, digital assets, artificial intelligence systems, smart contracts and 
 
 
 
55 UNCITRAL is one of the two subsidiary organs of the General Assembly of the United Nations with 
a legislative mandate. It is composed of 60 Member States and its sessions are open to United Nations 
system organizations (https://uncitral.un.org/).

distributed ledger technologies, and should not be used as an obstacle to such use and 
development;58 
 
(c) 
International efforts to develop a harmonized response to legal issues could 
pre-empt fragmented national legal responses and contribute to bridging the digital divide. 
Box 7  
Examples of legislation enacted to specifically address blockchain 
Most of this legislation deals with cryptocurrency and is predominantly regulatory in 
nature. 
Moreover, some of the legislation does not expressly refer to blockchain, but it is 
inspired by blockchain solutions, as is the case for the Liechtenstein law. These laws 
include: 
Belarus – Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.8 of 21 December 
2017 on development of digital economy establishes a regime to support the use of 
blockchain solutions at the Minsk Hi-tech Park; 
Italy – Law Decree No 135/2018, enacted with modifications by Law No 12 of 
11February 2019, gives the same legal effect to documents recorded using blockchain 
as an electronic timestamp; 
Liechtenstein – Law of 3 October 2019 on Tokens and TT Service Providers 
establishes a legal framework for transacting in digital tokens; 
Malta – the Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act, 2018, establishes a 
regime for the certification of blockchain software and architecture; 
United States – several States have introduced laws to enable the use of blockchain. 
Notable examples are the Electronic Transactions Act of Arizona (which states that 
“data on the ledger is protected with cryptography, is immutable and auditable and 
provides an uncensored truth”) and the “Blockchain Act” of Vermont.  
Source: UNCITRAL 
261. 
The work plan proposed by the secretariat of UNCITRAL includes a legal taxonomy 
and preparatory work on legislative texts dealing with automated contracting (including 
smart contracts), 59  the rights and obligations of parties to data transactions, asset 
tokenization,60 digital assets in the form of cryptocurrency, digital platforms and dispute 
resolution. 
262. 
The Inspector notes for the benefit of innovation units and other interested 
departments in the United Nations organizations that for the fifty-third session of 
UNCITRAL in 2020, the secretariat submitted additional reports on the context, definition, 
actors, legal regimes and a preliminary appraisal of existing UNCITRAL texts on artificial 
intelligence,61 data transactions62 and digital assets,63 which will form the basis of the legal 
 
 
 
58  In the context of UNCITRAL, distributed ledger technologies are defined as technologies and 
methods (including blockchain) that support a record of data (i.e., a “ledger”) that is retained on 
multiple networked computers (or “nodes”). Those technologies and methods include cryptographic 
techniques and consensus mechanisms that are designed to ensure that the same data is retained on 
each node (i.e., shared, replicated and synchronized) and that the data retained on each node remains 
complete and unaltered (i.e., immutable). Distributed ledgers are maintained by software run on the 
various nodes. 
 
59  In keeping with the UNCITRAL practice of respecting the principle of technology neutrality, the 
work on smart contracts does not focus solely on their development in distributed ledger technology 
systems, but through the prism of artificial intelligence and automated contracting. Although smart 
contracts are commonly associated with distributed ledgers, they predate the advent of distributed 
ledger technology and are deployed in other electronic environments (A/CN.9/1012, paras. 17 and 
18). 
 
60 A comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects of “token economy” can be found in Thomas G. 
Duenser, Legalize Blockchain!, 2020.

taxonomy. As a coordinating body within the United Nations system on legal issues 
relating to the digital economy and digital trade, including the use of blockchain and 
blockchain-based applications, the work of UNCITRAL is not only relevant to States, but 
also to the United Nations system organizations themselves. For instance, the UNCITRAL 
secretariat has indicated that the above-mentioned legal taxonomy may serve as a reference 
document for any organizations looking to deploy blockchain-based applications as tools to 
administer their internal regulations and contractual arrangements. 
263. 
This is work in progress, at the initial stage, but it is worth noting another 
UNCITRAL finding with an important bearing on the topic of the present report and the 
concerns expressed by current or potential users of blockchain applications: 
“… the administration and operation of distributed ledger systems does not itself 
appear to give rise to any novel legal issue, although certain legal issues, such as 
private international law issues, may become more prominent on account of the 
geographical distribution of nodes”.64 
264. 
At this juncture, it is useful to note that UNCITRAL is the only body in the United 
Nations system that has an institutionalized and systematic relationship with the 
International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT).  
 
 
Conclusion 
265. 
UNCITRAL has been mandated by the United Nations General Assembly as the 
core legal body in the United Nations system to coordinate legal activities in the field of 
international trade law for one main reason: 
“to avoid duplication of efforts, including among organizations […], and to promote 
efficiency, consistency and coherence in the modernization and harmonization of 
international trade law”.65 
266. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will lead to enhanced 
efficiency and effectiveness, to improved coordination and dissemination of practices and 
lessons learned. 
 
Recommendation 6 
The governing bodies of the United Nations system organizations should encourage 
Member States to engage with the United Nations Commission on International Trade 
Law in its exploratory and preparatory work on legal issues that relate to blockchain 
in the broader context of the digital economy and digital trade, including on dispute 
resolution, which is aimed at reducing legal insecurity in that field. 
267. 
The Inspector also recommends that the United Nations system organizations 
cooperate with the UNCITRAL secretariat by providing documentation on their 
experience, the lessons learned from their use of blockchain-supported applications 
and on their prospective needs from a legal standpoint. 
 
C. 
Developing in-house technical expertise on blockchain is useful and 
realistic 
268. 
Preparedness, at the operational and strategic levels, for using blockchain 
applications depends to a considerable extent on knowledge and understanding of 
blockchain. In the United Nations system, such preparedness should not be based

51 
exclusively on theoretical assumptions, which are abundantly present in the specialized 
literature. The lessons learned from the actual practice of blockchain applications should 
underlie all decisions made. 
269. 
For practical reasons, the United Nations system can take a proactive stand on 
blockchain, rather than a wait-and-see attitude, which will eventually lead to dependence on 
various vendors on the market. Such a dependence is not only a possible, but also a 
predictable, negative development. From a system-wide logic, it will lead to fragmentation, 
new silos, duplication and a waste of resources. To counteract that, consideration should be 
given to using solutions that are portable from one service provider to another. The novelty 
of blockchain offers a golden opportunity to the United Nations system to try, at this early 
stage, to develop its own minimum technical expertise including on its own blockchain 
protocols. 
270. 
Starting from this assumption, the participating organizations were asked to respond 
to the following question: “Would it be useful for the United Nations system to develop its 
own expertise in coding/programming/mining for blockchain applications?”  
271. 
Most of the respondents to that question answered in the affirmative. The main 
arguments for the system to develop its own expertise included: 
• Making certain basic coding available, on which the United Nations entities can 
build, may be a way to have a unified system-wide approach; 
• A joint resource could eliminate parallel and upfront investment for many 
organizations, thus benefiting the United Nations system as a whole; 
• The use of its own blockchain platform could help the United Nations system to 
leverage the technology while avoiding exclusive dependence on market providers 
whose resilience is not yet fully proven; 
• Building internal knowledge would be useful to serve as guidance and to increase 
the negotiating power of the United Nations organizations, even if the option chosen 
will be to work with external vendors; 
• Whether blockchain solutions are developed in-house or by external commercial 
partners, internal expertise is needed to safeguard implementation; 
• To assess the value of blockchain in the context of SDGs, such expertise will be 
necessary to run all categories of proofs of concept in the short term and the 
development of more mature prototypes in the longer term; 
• Internal expertise will allow the United Nations to remain up to date in handling 
financial transactions with banks and financial institutions, which increasingly use 
this technology; 
• The United Nations will be able to make sure that blockchain applications comply 
with international regulations, including with respect to human rights and 
environmental protection norms. 
272. 
Several other organizations also supported the idea of building in-house expertise on 
blockchain, with very pertinent caveats that are worth noting: (a) it should be limited to 
areas where high-volume usage or a critical mass of blockchain-related projects justify the 
effort; and (b) a business case should be rigorously identified. In addition, the coding needs 
to be collectively vetted, to be the best available and provide adequate security. 
273. 
Only one organization responded negatively to the question, pointing out that there 
was “an abundance of competent and (often) relatively affordable technical partners to 
leverage for coding”. In the view of that organization what was needed was “the ability to 
translate technical understanding into business applications/requirements and vice versa” 
and the ability to maintain the solutions that were adopted. 
274. 
A primordial condition for the best use of existing resources relates to building 
capacity and reducing dependence on the market by the use of open-source options. The 
implementation of the following recommendation may lead to more efficiency and savings 
of financial resources. It would support a learning curve for blockchain adoption by the 

--- Page 66 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
52 
entire United Nations system, while leading to more efficiency and cost saving through 
reducing duplication of effort. 
 
Recommendation 7 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations that have developed 
blockchain applications – in line with the call by the Secretary-General in his 
Roadmap for Digital Cooperation for the United Nations to deploy digital public 
goods – should follow, whenever possible, open-source principles when they develop 
software, and make available the codes to other United Nations organizations. 
275. 
JIU found overall support for the idea of building a minimal in-house technical 
expertise on blockchain in individual organizations. At the same time, there is also a 
realistic alternative to start such an effort with an entity that might have a pivotal role to 
that effect at the system-wide level. The UNICC reported that it had such capacities and it 
is already engaged in developing blockchain solutions. 
276. 
The Inspector admits that the best available option for organizations is often to 
resort to external resources. Even in such cases, there is a need for cautious approach in 
selecting such support. The number of blockchain solutions providers is increasing, but not 
all of them have a proven capacity to deliver and update in the longer term. 
277. 
The Inspector recommends that the United Nations Innovation Network 
establish a roster of external providers of blockchain solutions, accessible to all 
interested organizations. He notes that such rosters may exist at the level of some 
individual organizations. For example, WFP has established long-term agreements with 
providers of blockchain solutions and has procurement processes that could inspire, or be 
used by, other interested organizations. 
278. 
The in-house capacity of understanding and mastering emerging and innovative 
technologies, including blockchain, is an essential characteristic of an effective, modern 
and learning organization dedicated to effectively and efficiently delivering on its mandate 
and playing an important role in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
Owing to its decentralized structure and unique features, blockchain poses new challenges 
for the United Nations system at both the technical and strategic levels on issues such as 
project management and governance.  
279. 
Most organizations admitted the need for their staff to acquire a certain level of 
knowledge and understanding of blockchain and other digital technologies, in view of the 
need to adapt to a fast-changing technological environment.  
280. 
The type and level of training required will depend on the concrete forms of 
blockchain technology that organizations use or deal with. Entities that actually have 
blockchain applications in place would require a more elaborate and different type of 
training compared to those that are (only) dealing with some aspects of blockchain 
technology in other ways. The type and level of training should vary depending on whether 
it is addressed to technical staff, programme staff or management and decision makers. 
281. 
While the majority of organizations agreed that some training related to blockchain 
would be useful, different views were expressed as to which groups of staff should be 
trained and what type of training would be most useful: technical blockchain-related 
training for coding and programming or rather general training on blockchain for staff to 
better understand the functioning, opportunities and limitations of the technology.  
282. 
UNICEF took the view that entities could benefit from understanding how 
blockchain-based applications were designed, developed and managed. UN-Women noted 
that blockchain projects might involve disruptive collaboration and service models, at both 
the technical and programme levels. Being equipped with enough knowledge was the key 
prerequisite for starting and implementing any projects. 
283. 
FAO suggested that training on innovation methodologies would be most suitable, 
as blockchain projects might not work well if traditional project methodologies were 

--- Page 67 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
53 
adhered to. UNEP favoured the idea of regulatory sandboxes, which could allow 
practitioners to test products, services and business models in a lively environment while 
being exempt from the normal regulatory consequences. 
284. 
Overall, training on management of blockchain was considered important, as 
blockchain might not be the best solution in many cases. Promoting awareness sessions 
would be a very valuable tool to counteract the pitfalls the technology might bring. 
Similarly, content-specific training programmes about the real capabilities and limitations 
of the technology could provide suitable guidance to those planning to integrate blockchain 
into their projects. Finally, not only technical or project staff, but the line-of-business 
functions, finance, legal and other teams within an organization also needed to understand 
the business boundaries of blockchain. 
285. 
In conclusion, there are several arguments in favour of training on blockchain: 
• Blockchains may result in and involve disruptive collaboration and service models 
at both the technical and programme levels if not implemented properly. On the 
programme and design side, it is necessary to undertake a business process mapping 
prior to the application of blockchain for the activities envisaged; 
• On the technical side, staff must be aware of the potential benefits, limitations and 
risks of blockchain and the approach to project implementation should be based on 
the intrinsic features of blockchain technology. Blockchain projects may not work 
well if they follow the traditional United Nations project methodologies; 
• Training should create an understanding of how blockchain-based applications are 
designed, developed and managed to prepare staff and their organizations for new 
and innovative technologies and the future; 
• It could provide suitable guidance on the real capabilities and limitations of the 
technology to those planning to integrate blockchain into their projects. 
286. 
According to the arguments set out above and the responses of the organizations to 
the questionnaire, the following three levels of knowledge and understanding of blockchain 
applications may be useful and suitable for the following broad categories of staff/officials:  
 
(a) 
For programme staff a general understanding/basic knowledge of 
blockchains, including the arguments for and against them, and how blockchain-based 
applications are designed, developed and managed, as well as some understanding of how 
blockchain is selected (decision tree); 
 
(b) 
For technical staff handling blockchain projects, guidance on connecting 
blockchains to United Nations scenarios and understanding the technical details of the 
capabilities and limitations of blockchains and how blockchain technology and applications 
could be implemented; 
 
(c) 
For senior management and other decision makers, a basic understanding and 
knowledge of blockchain, including its general advantages and disadvantages, in the 
context of emerging technology and innovation, which would be useful in relation to taking 
strategic decisions for investing in those new technologies, including blockchain. 
287. 
The Inspector notes the existence of numerous online courses that can adress 
different levels of learning needs. Many courses are available at low cost, affordable for 
both interested staff members and organizations with smaller resources, in particular when 
training resources are limited. The implementation of the following recommendation may 
enhance efficiency in the use of resources and improve the professional skills of the staff 
involved, while facilitating the capacity of organizations to become more agile. 
288. 
The Inspector recommends that the executive heads of the United Nations 
organizations consider including in the organizational learning curricula, where 
appropriate and necessary, basic training on how blockchains and other digital 
technologies work, adapted to the organizational needs for (a) senior management and 
policy-makers, (b) project managers and (c) staff at technical levels.

D. 
First steps towards a culture of collaboration and inter-agency action in 
the use of blockchain 
289. 
In theory, blockchain seems to offer considerable potential for inter-agency 
cooperation and joint activities, by virtue of its strengths as a distributed system in an 
environment without central control. The advent of blockchain at this early stage of 
development therefore comes with the reasonable assumption that the United Nations 
system organizations, when contemplating its adoption, should primarily consider projects 
that would imply a pooling of resources, sharing knowledge and expertise, scalability and 
collaboration, rather than the development of new silos. 
290. 
According to the views collected by JIU, the participating organizations almost 
unanimously share such an assumption, based on a variety of arguments: 
• Blockchain being a new technological tool, few organizations have enough expertise 
to fully understand what it offers. A system-wide approach to blockchain will 
facilitate the access of such organizations to knowledge and expertise; 
• Setting up a blockchain infrastructure could be costly. It is preferable that 
organizations seek collaboration and co-scaling, instead of undertaking small pilots 
in isolation; 
• Organizations that have managed to make good use of blockchain in support of the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can make that practice available, so that 
the organizations of United Nations system as a whole can leverage each other’s 
knowledge; 
• Irrespective of the specific mandates of various organizations, some processes that 
can be automated through blockchain (grant disbursements, transparent and 
traceable supply chains, etc.) could be adopted by multiple programmes and funds; 
• By using blockchain, the United Nations system could leverage its convening 
power, forge more results-oriented partnerships with the private sector and promote 
applications to the field programmes; Blockchains allow the integration of systems 
when the same population is targeted by multiple organizations and when holistic 
outcomes are desirable; 
• Joint learning, knowledge and experience-sharing among United Nations 
organizations would provide not only a deeper common understanding of innovation 
across sectors, but also lead to a coordinated approach to blockchain at the global 
level; 
• Joint blockchain technical capabilities could facilitate coordination mechanisms for 
distributing funds among stakeholders to counteract overlapping and harmful 
competition for funds. They may also promote higher levels of accountability and 
transparency with respect to the allocation of funds. 
291. 
The emerging consensus on the need for inter-agency cooperation in awareness-
raising, knowledge-building and coordinated projects is supported by two important 
initiatives: the United Nations Digital Solutions Centre and the United Nations 
Innovation Network. What is particularly significant about these initiatives is that they 
have a system-wide vocation, which adds to the operational mandate of the United Nations 
International Computing Centre. The Inspector recommends coordination and 
communication between those three entities on digital transformation processes, 
including on the potential use of blockchain, as a way to improve system-wide 
coherence and action, and improve the access of all interested organizations to an 
understanding of blockchain. 
292. 
The United Nations Innovation Network is conceived as an informal, collaborative 
community of United Nations innovators interested in sharing their expertise and 
experience with others to promote and advance innovation within the United Nations 
system. It has already created promising tools related to blockchain. One is an inter-agency 
platform for blockchain technology (the Atrium), designed to support learning, 
collaboration and conversation. The other is a publication entitled “A practical guide to 

--- Page 69 ---
JIU/REP/2020/7 
 
55 
using blockchain within the United Nations” that is intended to offer a basic understanding 
of blockchain and general guidance on evaluation of its possible uses.  
293. 
The Inspector welcomes the work done so far by the United Nations Innovation 
Network and hopes that the network will keep instilling a new culture of inter-agency 
cooperation with respect to blockchain and other digital technologies. 
294. 
The Inspector notes with interest that most of the participating organizations have a 
system-wide vision and can envisage, at this early stage, the establishment of system-wide 
entities dealing with blockchain, rather than individual undertakings and developing new 
silos. The most notable of those proposals is the creation of a blockchain shared-service 
centre to provide a mechanism for technical operations, strategic guidance on the adoption 
of blockchain technology and technical support for implementation of projects. Such a 
mechanism may also, as suggested by UNFPA, “enable capitalizing on experiences from 
the entire United Nations system by reducing the number of one-off initiatives that might 
prove not scalable”. The Inspector notes that this desideratum is already taking shape 
through the establishment of the United Nations Digital Solutions Centre. 
295. 
The United Nations Digital Solutions Centre is the second major initiative aimed 
at enabling synergies and collaboration across the United Nations system and bringing a 
holistic view of digitization. Its mission is to test and implement cutting-edge technology 
pilots that can be scaled across multiple United Nations organizations. The Centre was 
founded by UNHCR and WFP and utilizes the operational capacity of UNICC. Figure V 
represents the technologies used by the Centre including blockchain. 
Box 8 
The Atrium – an inter-agency collaboration tool 
The Atrium is an inter-agency decentralized blockchain-based collaboration tool 
designed to both enable collaboration and reduce the friction related to innovating across 
United Nations agencies that are interested in blockchain. It was established by UNDP, 
UNICEF and WFP under the auspices of the United Nations Innovation Network and is 
open to all United Nations agencies. At a high level, the Atrium consists of three 
components:  
• A curated list of learning resources;  
• A list of blockchain-based applications built within the United Nations, including 
project overviews, team contact information and access to details, such as code;  
• A community forum to engage with United Nations innovators in knowledge-
building. 
As a permissioned, private blockchain, accompanied by a distributed applications store, 
the Atrium allows interested United Nations agencies to share intellectual property and 
test applications in a secure, sandbox environment.

296. 
The Inspector welcomes the creation of the Digital Solutions Centre, which 
heralds the beginning of a new era in the way the United Nations system will handle 
digital transformation in the future, and he recommends that the participating 
organizations support it. 
297. 
The most important project proposed by the Digital Solutions Centre is the creation 
of a unique personal United Nations ID, using blockchain technology, which is portable 
across organizations. The proposal foresees that every United Nations organization could 
become a trusted authority writing information onto the blockchain. The organizations 
could run their own nodes separately, while the system will ensure scalability and 
interoperability.66 
298. 
The Inspector recommends that the executive heads of the United Nations 
organizations support the creation of a United Nations digital ID which will have 
multiple positive consequences in the longer term in terms of saving time and 
resources, facilitating staff mobility by allowing certification and recognition of their 
knowledge and skills, reducing bureaucracy and enhancing system-wide coherence. 
299. 
The promise of more cooperation in the field, in terms of effective inter-agency 
collaboration, is also tested through the Building Blocks project, currently the largest and 
most complex blockchain application in the United Nations. The Inspector encourages 
support for and adherence to this pioneering initiative, which has the value of an 
experiment of system-wide relevance for humanitarian operations. 
300. 
The implementation of the following recommendation will strengthen coherence at 
both strategic and operational levels and inter-agency cooperation. 
 
Recommendation 8 
The executive heads of the United Nations system organizations, through the relevant 
coordination mechanisms, including with support from the United Nations 
International Computing Centre, should consider the adoption of a non-binding inter-
agency blockchain governance framework for use by interested organizations, with a 
view to ensuring coherent and consistent blockchain approaches across the system by 
the end of 2022, including for projects that may involve multiple United Nations 
organizations.

now – UNJSPF and UNICC. Ideally, in the 
future all United Nations agencies, 
programmes and offices that will participate in 
the common digital ID will be able to run a 
node, which can be physically hosted at 
UNICC but be owned by the participating 
agency.

Habitat 
Tracking the ownership of parcels of land in 
Afghanistan. An immutable version of land records is 
created, which can then serve as the basis for other 
government services, such as urban planning, citizen 
engagement and revenue generation. 
Anchoring on a blockchain is used for this 
implementation. It is a simple way to 
notarize documents or time stamp data by 
adding a hash on the blockchain, which 
makes data tamper-proof.  
LTO Network is the service provider.

 Blockchain applications that organizations envisage using in 
the future 
Organization 
Potential use 
UNCTAD 
Online dispute resolution for consumers: a project to deliver blockchain-based 
online dispute resolution for consumers as a means of improving international trade 
and electronic commerce. UNCTAD could provide expertise on consumer protection 
issues within the United Nations and covers capacity-building and technical 
assistance issues relating to consumer protection. A partner will develop the 
blockchain technology.  
UNEP 
Money transfer and smart contracts: a tool for Member States to check how 
resources are allocated and distributed to UNEP partners or service suppliers and to 
which project they are linked. A smart contract feature added to the money transfer 
would automatically unleash part of the allocated project funding only when goals are 
achieved. 
Supply chain tracking and monitoring: the purpose is to trace and follow 
environmentally sensitive commodities in order to create a safer environment, with 
possible use of blockchain-based tokenization. 
Funding and fund disbursements to partners could run on blockchain for 
transparency and accountability in the framework of the United Nations Decade for 
Ecosystem Restoration. Certificates of participation with associated carbon 
sequestration impacts could be automatically issued to donors. The Decade could use 
blockchain to develop an ecosystem services marketplace and an ecosystem services 
standard and tradeable tokens to incentivize restoration. 
UNFPA 
UNFPA is considering the use of blockchain technology in the context of registering 
childbirth and health supply chain management. 
UNRWA

micropayments, and possible leveraging of decentralized financing mechanisms 
enabled by blockchain.  
Child rights: potential applications to protect children’s data, manage digital 
identification and/or create and manage digital credentials. 
UNIDO 
TruBudget: an open-source application developed to increase efficiency and 
traceability of funds by providing Member States and donors with greater 
transparency on the allocation of resources. 
Agriculture food chain: potential use of blockchain for inclusive and sustainable 
industrial development in agrofood chains in the country by improving traceability 
and transparency in the value chain. 
Trade finance tools: trade finance tools based on blockchain for supporting small 
and medium enterprises in Africa to access financing.

Digital signatures and smart contracts: potential application at the ILO for internal 
administrative purposes in the light of digital transformation. 
Supply chain monitoring: leveraging blockchain technologies to achieve 
transparency and security in monitoring labour conditions in the supply chain. 
UPU 
Postal supply chain: blockchain as an alternative for electronic data interchange 
transmissions among actors in the postal supply chain to fulfil the need for data 
privacy, with a model where every actor (the post, customs organizations, air 
transport security) will see only the data it needs, when needed, to perform its duties. 
eWallet: a blockchain-powered solution to complement the UPU offer for postal 
payment services. 
WHO 
Health information exchange: patient data management, electronic health records, 
prescriptions and billing claims management, international vaccination certification. 
Supply chain management: combating counterfeit medications and other forms of 
medical fraud. 
Digital credentials: Blockcerts is currently being considered for issuing, viewing and 
verifying blockchain-based credentials for the WHO Academy. 
WIPO 
Potential uses of the technology in the ecosystem of intellectual property. 
WMO  
Weather data exchange: blockchain technology will possibly be implemented to 
support the exchange of licensed data.

Annex III 
 
 An indicative overview of distributed ledger technology 
solutions for use cases for key challenges in the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (JIU summary) 
Source: International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunication Standardization 
Sector, ITU-T Focus Group on Application of Distributed Ledger Technology, Technical 
Report FG DLT D2.1, Distributed ledger technology use cases, 2019. 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goal 
Challenge 
A possible distributed ledger technology (DLT) approach 
Goal 1 
One in 10 people in lower middle-
income countries living below the 
international poverty line. 
DLT can automatically record transactions on a secure ledger 
with near-instantaneous financial settlement. Shorter payment 
cycles could be harnessed to help address poverty and 
promote equal rights to economic resources. 
Goal 2 
Insufficient access to nutritious food 
all year round. 
DLT could strengthen the supply side, particularly for small-
scale food producers and family farmers, enabling them to 
better access markets and receive equal treatment in the 
supply chain. 
Goal 3 
Non-communicable diseases and 
mental health have been attracting 
new attention and funding, 
competing with infectious diseases. 
DLT can support enhanced prevention and treatment 
outcomes through breaking down data silos across medical 
providers and enabling the tokenization and incentivization of 
physically or mentally beneficial activities. 
Goal 4 
Access to inclusive education. 
DLT-based platforms could connect students, educators and 
service providers in online sessions where progress, 
attendance and completion are automatically tracked. 
Goal 5 
Gender equality and empowerment 
of women. 
DLT could help women earn and retain control over 
additional income and mitigate online harassment. 
Goal 6 
The distribution of clean water is 
globally unbalanced. 
DLT combined with Internet of Things sensors, would enable 
households, industries, water managers and policymakers to 
make more informed decisions. 
Goal 7 
Increase the share of renewable 
energy and double the efficiency of 
energy production. 
DLT enables the tokenization of energy trading platforms and 
the use of peer-to-peer networks to trade renewable energy. 
Goal 8 
Government access to domestic 
financing at a reasonable cost. 
DLT can allow the sale of small-value mobile retail bonds and 
promote inclusive growth by democratizing sovereign debt. 
Goal 9 
Economic development. 
Trading with a DLT-based regulatory-compliant global 
currency can enable microtransactions, which can be an 
important enabler of services tailored for the poor. 
Goal 10 
Reducing inequalities in the 
economy, governance, rights and 
decision-making. 
DLT can enable better economic equality by reducing the cost 
of remittances and open new ways for citizens to get involved 
in decision-making. 
Goal 11 
The increasing urbanization and 
number of megacities. 
DLT can provide a cost-effective and trustworthy 
enhancement for local democracy within cities. 
Goal 12 
More transparency and visibility of 
value chains and production 
processes in order to gain a better 
understanding of risks and ensure 
due diligence. 
Tracing of products in supply chains relates closely to 
consumer awareness of the origins of products, sustainable 
production methods and health implications. 
Goal 13 
The risk of irreversible ecological 
disaster.  
DLT can support the development of carbon marketplaces by 
using platforms for the trading of assets that represent carbon, 
while guaranteeing immutability and transparency.

Sustainable 
Development 
Goal 
Challenge 
A possible distributed ledger technology (DLT) approach 
Goal 14 
Protect marine and coastal 
ecosystems from pollution and 
overexploitation. 
DLT can provide the baseline architecture for interoperable 
data collection, allowing better management of ecosystems, 
more informed decision-making and increased accountability. 
Goal 15 
Reversing the effects of land 
degradation and desertification. 
DLT can be used to incentivize organizations and individuals 
to increase the scale and efficiency of conservation protection 
by offering small cash payments in exchange for conserving 
nature. 
Goal 16 
Strengthening the rule of law. 
Smart contracts executed on DLT platforms can be used to 
automate and enforce agreements between business entities. 
Goal 17 
Improving the debt management of 
and promote investment in 
developing countries. 
DLT can be used to facilitate partnerships and collaboration 
between Governments, companies, academia, civil society 
and individuals where trustworthy information and value 
transfers are needed.
