Conjuring a Blockchain Pilot: Ignorance and Innovation in 
Humanitarian Aid

ABSTRACT
When aid professionals adopt high tech pilot projects, ignorance, 
blind faith, misplaced trust, and authentic expertise all come into 
play. Based on ethnographic research in Jordan, I examine how a 
refugee aid organisation produces and applies a blockchain pilot. 
Innovative pilots help international aid organisations attract and 
maintain their funding sources and reputations. I argue that The 
Blockchain Pilot is ‘conjured’ as a product to be promoted to a 
marketplace of aid donors. ‘Conjurings’ are the spectacles and 
magical appearances that draw an audience of investors. 
Ethnographic research suggests that conjurings drive capitalist 
markets. Rather than just requiring knowledge and expertise, I 
argue that conjurings entail key forms of ignorance: (i) confusion, 
(ii) illusion, (iii) disappearance, and (iv) misdirection. This ignor­
ance is both strategic and inadvertent. Ignorance, just like knowl­
edge, is shaped by hierarchical power relations. The 
organisation’s experimental adoption of a blockchain database 
system benefits some stakeholders (innovators, private partners) 
more than others (local aid workers and refugees). The conjuring 
of the pilot is what justifies the adoption of blockchain, even 
though a simple database would have sufficed.
Introduction
Donors like to hear we are using blockchain because they like innovation, especially if it 
is about efficiency and tracking where their money is going. And as we all know, donors 
are really the be all and end all in this [humanitarian aid] sector. It’s kind of bad that 
we’ve received so much attention and investment with this pilot even before we’ve done 
anything. Don’t hate the players hate the game, I guess.  
Lina, Head of Programmes, Cash4Work aid organisation, December 2018
On a grey day in Amman in the winter of 2018, a dozen humanitarian sector 
professionals gathered around a large conference table. They were there to 
discuss The Blockchain Pilot, which would soon be using the database tech­
nology blockchain to deliver financial aid to refugee women in Jordan. The

workshop brought together key stakeholders to agree on the key objectives of 
the pilot prior to its launch in Al-Za’atari and Al-Azraq refugee camps. Lina 
managed the activities of Cash4Work1 Jordan, the aid organisation leading the 
blockchain pilot. Two aid workers and two IT managers from Cash4Work 
were in the room. Others included the New Ventures Project Manager at 
BasicAssistance, the partner aid organisation which had first initiated The 
Blockchain Pilot, and the Business Development Manager from a Jordanian 
biometrics company. Opening the discussion about the factors motivating this 
innovation in refugee aid, Lina was candid. Before even achieving anything, 
blockchain had already boosted Cash4Work’s reputation.
Replacing an analogue cash-in-hand system, The Blockchain Pilot (still 
running in 2024) uses blockchain, coupled with biometric iris recognition, 
to deliver essential financial aid to people living in refugee camps. According 
to the aid agencies’ promotions of The Blockchain Pilot, blockchain revolu­
tionises the humanitarian knowledge economy by introducing real-time trans­
parency over transaction data. This data is secure and visible to 
a ‘decentralised network’ of coordinated organisations (Cash4Work and 
BasicAssistance). Blockchain brings logistical efficiency and value for money: 
by circumventing traditional financial intermediaries (local banks), 
Cash4Work reportedly saves 90% of previous transaction fees. Cash4Work 
also claims that the pilot ‘empowers’ refugee women with independently held, 
blockchain-based ‘digital wallets’, accessed through individual biometric 
checks.1 But first and foremost, Lina emphasised the beneficial business effects 
of using blockchain: recognition and funding from humanitarian donors for 
her agency. These benefits were immediate and not tied to any proof of the 
technology’s concrete achievements. Nor was any technical understanding of 
blockchain required to make the business case for using it. Indeed, over coffee 
after the workshop, Cash4Work aid workers expressed cynicism and confu­
sion about the claims being made for blockchain. Throughout my fieldwork in 
Jordan, aid professionals showed little interest in the mechanics and specifics 
of this back-end database technology itself. Instead, they viewed The 
Blockchain Pilot as a staged spectacle, a political gameplay in which they all 
played a part.
Over sixty different aid industry blockchain projects, mostly short-term 
pilots, have been launched across South-East Asia, Latin America, the Pacific, 
African countries, and the Middle East since about 2016. These pilots have 
involved international NGOs, UN agencies, non-profit organisations, other 
humanitarian and development aid actors, and crisis-affected groups, from 
refugees and stateless people to hurricane survivors. Aid organisations are 
using blockchain for supply chain tracking (from cocoa to pigs), personal 
records systems (for medical data or educational certificates across borders),

self-sovereign identity schemes for stateless refugees, alternative currencies, 
cash transfers, remittance projects, and cryptocurrency funds for aid dona­
tions (Cheesman 2022c). Blockchain promises to make aid coordination, 
targeting, monitoring, and delivery more transparent, secure, cheap, and 
efficient. However, a review of 43 use cases found a proliferation of articles 
and whitepapers about the technology’s potential benefits for the aid sector, 
but no in-practice analysis (Burg, Murphy, and Pétraud 2018). Aid industry 
studies note the lack of field-based investigations and project evaluations as 
a significant knowledge gap (Coppi and Fast 2019; Hart 2023; McDonald and 
Fast 2019). Blockchain is hard to pin down. It is not a singular technology but 
a family of database systems, all based on cryptography, the very science of 
ciphers and secrets. In refugee aid, debates about blockchain are characterised 
by slippery terms, complex technicalities, and competing logics (Cheesman  
2020; Cheesman and Slavin 2021). In general, blockchain has been likened to 
snake oil or magic beans as a much hyped, poorly understood panacea 
unequipped to solve all the problems it is set up for (Gerard 2017).
This paper is about the games of ignorance, blind faith, misplaced trust, and 
authentic expertise that come into play as aid professionals – mainly 
Cash4Work aid workers – enrol blockchain into everyday humanitarian 
work. It is based on ethnographic research in Jordan between May 2018 and 
December 2019 with Cash4Work and their partners (BasicAssistance and 
private sector companies) as they produce and apply a blockchain pilot. 
Innovative pilots help aid organisations attract and maintain their funding 
sources and reputations. I suggest that The Blockchain Pilot is ‘conjured’ as 
a conceptual product to be promoted to a demanding marketplace of donors. 
‘Conjurings’ are the spectacles and magical appearances that draw an audience 
of investors. Ethnographic research suggests that conjurings drive capitalist 
markets (Ho 2009; Preda 2023; Tsing 2000). Rather than just requiring knowl­
edge and expertise, I argue that conjurings entail key forms of ignorance: (i) 
confusion, (ii) illusion, (iii) disappearance, and (iv) misdirection. This ignor­
ance is both strategic and inadvertent. Ignorance, just like knowledge, is 
shaped by hierarchical power relations. Cash4Work’s experimental adoption 
of blockchain benefits some stakeholders (innovators, private partners) more 
than others (local aid workers and refugees). The conjuring of the pilot 
ultimately justifies the adoption of blockchain, even though a simple database 
would have sufficed.
‘Web3 is Going Just Great’: Blockchain’s Politics of Ignorance
Blockchain is arcane. Since its rise to fame around 2016 as the database system 
underpinning the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, technical explainers, glossaries, 
decoders, and guides abound. It is variously discussed as a unified concept 
or thing (‘blockchain’) but also an assortment of different types of things 
GEOPOLITICS

(‘blockchains’). Blockchain innovation is now referred to as Web3. Both terms 
are regularly described as ‘something that nearly everyone has heard of [. . .] 
yet at the same time essentially no one understands’ (Hautzinger 2022). It 
rapidly became a satirical subject with meme-like, fetish status. In the tech 
industry, the sarcastic refrain ‘put it on a blockchain!’ became emblematic of 
popular resistance to a techno-solutionist fad (Wired 2018). Blockchain and its 
associated technologies and techniques (magical terms include ‘oracles’, 
‘ether’, and ‘zero-knowledge proofs’) are anticipated to provide the conditions 
for the prosperity of the world’s most marginalised populations. Blockchain- 
based solutions are touted to help undocumented people access asylum, resist 
dispossessions of land and property rights, redistribute wealth, and mitigate 
global inequalities. Yet it is difficult to follow or imagine how exactly the 
technology will fulfil these grand promises.
Blockchain is associated with various competing ideas: economic freedom, 
the ideal of the commons, anti-authoritarianism, resistance to corporate 
surveillance, competitive individualism. Proponents argue that the tools of 
decentralised computing offer a meaningful challenge to platform capitalism 
and its monopolistic business models. The technology enables ‘solidarity 
finance’: for example, a high volume of emergency cryptocurrency donations 
during the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake bypassed the usual fees and frictions 
associated with charitable donations (Scott 2016; WEF 2023). Humanitarian 
organisations delivering aid payments to high-risk locations and remote, 
marginalised communities face significant challenges (Hart 2023, 2). Here, 
blockchains could considerably improve the speed, cost-effectiveness, and 
transparency of aid payments, providing alternative channels where financial 
infrastructure is fragile or underdeveloped (ibid). The tech even seems capable 
of disrupting traditional, paternalistic models of humanitarian and develop­
ment aid by enabling grassroots, peer-to-peer economic activity among aid 
recipients and local markets (Kshetri 2023; Manski and Bauwens 2020).
While promising, progressive blockchain networks are largely still 
‘thought experiments’ while the most powerful, successful ones are ‘extrac­
tive’ (Sadowski and Beegle 2023, 7). Extractive blockchain projects are 
driven by the business-as-usual motives of unscrupulous venture capitalists. 
They profit from user data and tend to promote fictitious assets. There is 
a significant discrepancy between the magical thinking surrounding block­
chain-based innovations and their concrete effects. Molly White catalogues 
these in her famous satirical blog ‘Web3 Is Going Just Great’. Her post ‘It’s 
not still the early days’, for example, lampoons blockchain PR. Despite the 
prevalence of scams, financial meltdowns, and environmental costs,2 pro­
ponents find new ways of kicking accountability into the long grass, mak­
ing faithful publics into ‘suckers’ (White 2022). It is difficult to sort true 
believers in blockchain from those ‘playing the game’ (Swartz 2021, 13). 
Critics suggest that using blockchain rarely makes sense: this is an

inefficient, overly complex tech which often causes more problems than it 
solves, and claims to remove properties of socio-technical systems which 
are arguably inevitable and essential, like trust and centralisation (Financial 
Times 2019a; Lehdonvirta 2016; Moxinspike 2022). The fear of missing out 
(‘FOMO’) is a key factor driving blockchain’s uptake (Swartz 2017, 2021). 
FOMO motivates aid donors too. It also explains why plenty of projects 
mysteriously invoke the name of blockchain, but do not actually require or 
even use it, or any other form of distributed ledger technology (Financial 
Times 2019b; Frederik 2020).
Experimental blockchain initiatives in the Global South are bringing finan­
cial inclusion to low-income and marginalised groups. They are speeding up 
humanitarian aid transfers and reducing transaction costs. But they are also 
generating new risks and harms for people who lack rights and safety nets 
(Cheesman 2022c). Many aid industry pilots enrol refugee end-users without 
choice of alternatives, in ways that disrupt and damage their economic rou­
tines and relationships (Cheesman 2022a; Cheesman and Mahmoudi 2024). 
Blockchain pilots often involve predetermined applications not sufficiently 
adapted to local contexts such as people’s connectivity, resources, and needs 
(Hart 2023, 18). They disproportionately benefit powerful governance institu­
tions and their private partners: for example, the Web3 industry gains legiti­
macy through involvement in the global ‘banking the unbanked’ agenda (Jutel  
2023; Lemberg-Pedersen and Haioty 2020; Madianou 2019). Despite technical 
criticism and broken promises, blockchain projects continue to proliferate. 
Sam Altman’s Worldcoin network is among the most notorious: the system 
stores the identity codes of over 10 million registered users, who receive free 
crypto tokens in exchange for a scan of their iris (Steyerl 2023). In Ukraine, the 
UNHCR is delivering emergency aid with an untested blockchain-based 
currency (Cheesman 2023, 513).
Much like AI, blockchain is widely misunderstood as a unitary, revolu­
tionary entity, invested with agency and coherence. But blockchains are socio- 
technical infrastructures (Cheesman 2022b, 52) with a structural role: they 
reorganise data, knowledge, and relationships, giving rise to struggles around 
access and exclusion, transparency and accountability, labour and mainte­
nance, ownership and control. Infrastructures entail very material adminis­
trative systems and techniques. In the case of The Blockchain Pilot, these 
include Excel spreadsheets, iris scans, payee databases, data entry work, and 
cash storage facilities, as we will see. Infrastructures are accompanied by 
a range of competing rationalities, ideals, and promises (Anand, Gupta, and 
Appel 2018; Larkin 2013). This is a field of innovation characterised by 
genuine hope but also mystery and uncertainty, tricks, scams, and spectacle. 
The ignorance surrounding blockchain needs to be taken seriously as part of 
the politics of its adoption, design, and everyday use, rather than disregarded 
as separate from the ‘technicality’ of blockchain infrastructure.

Rather than a pejorative term denoting simply the absence of knowledge, 
ignorance is a productive social practice that demands ethnographic attention 
(High, Kelly, and Mair 2012). Unknowns can be useful in the pursuit of political- 
economic agendas (McGoey 2019). Ignorance-making is both deliberate and 
inadvertent. It may result from a strategic ploy, selective attention, or be con­
veniently drawn upon as a resource (Proctor and Schiebinger 2008, 3). Ignorance 
involves omissions and gaps but is also actively produced, surfed, and shaped 
through acts of neglecting, forgetting, excluding, refusing, or denying. These 
should not simply be characterised as the calculated, wilful actions of omniscient 
human institutions. Ignorance arises from messy, contested, dispersed socio- 
technical practices (Scheel 2024). In other words, data and technology, not just 
humans, facilitate the production and circulation of ignorance. Ignorance is not 
just a bug: it is an integral part of what blockchains are and do, and for whom.
Pilots as Products: Conjuring ’The Blockchain Pilot’
Humanitarian agencies supporting refugees are increasingly expected to inno­
vate as part of their performance of care and credibility: a performance in 
which the crucial audience is their donors in the international community – 
such as nation states like the US, high net worth individuals, the EU, and 
international NGOs (McDonald, Sandvik, and Jacobsen 2017). This perfor­
mance sustains their role in the global system of border and migration 
management.4 The gap between humanitarian resources and requirements is 
growing: with budgets constraints and concerns around accountability, donors 
are pushing for cost-effective, innovative solutions (Bruder and Baar 2024). 
New technology pilots serve a key PR function in drumming up investment, 
legitimacy, and trust from the international community. Producing and pro­
moting projects is a central objective for humanitarian organisations, not just 
helping people: they sell projects in a kind of market, where donors are the 
consumers (Krause 2014). Facing the pressure to ‘align’ with tech sector 
The Blockchain Pilot: Blockchain in Name Only? 
The Blockchain Pilot is a private, permissioned blockchain system based on Ethereum. Only predefined entities (the 
aid agencies) can process transactions.3 Unlike public, peer-to-peer networks such as the Bitcoin blockchain, only 
permitted authorities can view and edit code. Some call these kinds of blockchain systems ‘glorified spreadsheets’ 
(Prasse-Freeman, 2022, p. 568). The Pilot has been criticised as a ‘BINO’ (Blockchain In Name Only) project: it makes 
use of blockchain technology but in a highly centralised manner. The Project Manager, Alex, disagrees with this 
characterisation, yet has publicly admitted that the same outcomes could have been achieved with a normal 
shared database. The term ‘digital wallet’ is also something of a misnomer: refugees cannot access the balance and 
transactions record on a personal device; they cannot credit money, only withdraw it; they do not have custody of 
the wallet, Cash4Work does. As we will see, neither refugees nor Cash4Work aid workers have the power to interact 
with the information available on the blockchain ledger. The controversy around the necessity of using blockchain 
in the pilot reflects the diverse projects that still come to be labelled blockchain, and underscores the importance of 
using the blockchain label within the gameplay of aid industry pilots.

partners, aid professionals work with partners to promote innovation projects 
as unique and necessary (Henriksen 2023, 29). Funding goes to time-limited, 
project-based innovation pilots, which often do not scale up into long-term 
solutions (Savoy 2022, 2; Hart 2023, 6). Humanitarian innovation is defined by 
its interest in novelty, often for novelty’s sake; high and low-tech examples 
include PeePoo Bags, LifeStraws and PlumpyNut pouches (Scott-Smith 
2016).5 These innovation projects rely on business vocabulary (‘agile’, ‘lean’, 
‘cost-effective’) and triumphalist, exaggerated narratives. Aid agencies and 
partners gloss over what a technology actually does and precisely how it 
works and instead ascribe magical powers to it (ibid). This helps to promote, 
leverage, and sell the technology as a new but shortly irreplaceable component 
of aid – even if it offers only superficial, modest improvements to people’s 
lives, or possibly none at all.
Innovation pilots are products promoted to a marketplace of aid 
donors. Mainstream economists might view market principles and 
mechanisms (supply and demand, rational choice, pricing, and so on) 
as neutral and independent from cultural life. But the creation and 
maintenance of capitalist markets in general relies on spectacles and 
appearances (Ho 2009; Preda 2023; Tsing 2000). For Tsing (2000, 118), 
‘the possibility of economic performance must be conjured like a spirit 
to draw an audience of potential investors’. Here, ‘magic, rather than 
strict description, calls capital’ (ibid, p. 120). Conjuring is an ‘art’ 
practiced by a range of actors analysing, regulating, reporting on, and 
investing in new market frontiers. Spectacles and performances are not 
just abstract metaphors here. They are enacted practically and materially 
(De Genova 2013, 1184). Advertising, the official art form of capitalist 
societies, is ‘a highly organised and professional system of magical 
inducements and satisfactions’ (Williams 1980, 134). From crypto start- 
ups to Wall Street investment bankers to street level entrepreneurs in 
India, ‘economies of appearance’ are maintained by everyday profes­
sional rituals (Bear 2015, 422; Ho 2009; Yogarajah n.d.). Through 
launch events, conferences, networking meetings, annual reports, and 
earnings calls, an audience of investors are given promises, narrations, 
and assurances. Infrastructure projects (from roads to blockchain pay­
ment systems) come with spectacles and enchantments: these are the 
socio-technical practices which create and satisfy audiences, uphold 
promise despite the capacity to fail and disappoint, and ultimately 
serve the interests of those with a stake (Harvey and Knox 2012; Valk, 
Preda, and Xu 2023).
This paper builds on the ‘economies of appearance’ literature: conjuring 
works on ignorance and the will to believe rather than just requiring knowl­
edge and expertise. Mystery, speculation, and rumour shape capitalist markets 
(Bear 2015, 422; Tsing 2000, 126). Uncertainty, controversy, and 
GEOPOLITICS

disenchantment are part of the spectacle which dazzles, conceals, and con­
fuses, enabling companies to resist accountability (Neff and Nagy n.d.). 
Innovation projects evoke the latest digital technologies and de-emphasise 
whether their system is sufficiently understood or even understandable. This 
allows for deployment in different environments, regardless of whether more 
development time is needed, or if the system needs to be built at all (Ananny 
and Crawford 2016, 985). As in Marx’s notion of ‘commodity fetishism’, 
marvellous promises about new infrastructure projects rely on hiding the 
conditions under which they are constructed (Harvey and Knox 2012, 529). 
Investment in humanitarian innovation is an existential priority for the 
organisations making the promises, which rely far less on evidence than on 
the conjuring of magical (dis)appearances. As at any magic show, the conjur­
ing of Cash4Work’s blockchain pilot relied on forms of ignorance: (i) confu­
sion, (ii) illusion, (iii) disappearance, and (iv) misdirection. But ignorance is 
not just strategically manufactured. Analysing it as such entertains 
a conspiratorial logic (Scheel 2024, 3). This study also finds forms of ignorance 
that are inadvertent, and those that constitute local aid workers’ playful, subtle 
resistance to humanitarian innovation and the performance it requires.
Materials and Methods
I conducted participant observation with aid workers in and around refugee 
camps and in the headquarters of country offices, IT and data management 
staff, the monitoring and evaluation team, and other Cash4Work staff imple­
menting The Blockchain Pilot between May 2018 and December 2019.6 This 
was part of a broader study involving other key stakeholders (see Figure 1), 
including refugee groups. I spent considerable time with Cash4Work aid 
workers on the 2-hour journeys to and from the camps each day, within the 
Al-Za’atari and Al-Azraq camp Women’s Centres, and in walkalongs to the 
camp supermarkets. With Cash4Work Jordan I co-organised 5 participatory 
workshops which included the partner agencies and companies involved with 
implementing the pilot. I sustained the research using video calls, messaging 
platforms, and emails during and for another year after fieldwork in Jordan. 
This was supplemented with reviewing grey literature produced by and about 
The Blockchain Pilot in articles, press releases, videos, and webinars, and over 
30 key informant interviews with aid industry experts involved in or following 
the humanitarian adoption of blockchain.
Gatekeeping and opacity around The Blockchain Pilot were considerable 
research challenges. Knowledge asymmetries of ‘limited presence, partial 
information and uncertain connections’ are characteristic of ethnography 
and the humanitarian field alike (Jensen 2010). The securitisation of research 
in refugee camps limited my access to specific locations and time periods. Aid 
agencies are cautious and risk-averse, tasked with protecting vulnerable 
1080

subjects but also guarding their politically neutral reputations, public funding 
sources, and sensitive commercial information (Lewis et al. 2019; Van der 
Haar, Heijmans, and Hilhorst 2013). The research involved difficult scaven­
ging to trace and access information, and negotiations around confidentiality 
and academic freedom. While recording overlooked critical perspectives on 
the pilot, I resisted the right of aid agencies to approve research findings, but 
with a good faith research agreement in place, I use pseudonyms and other 
narrative strategies to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the organisa­
tions and staff as far as possible.
Jordan only gained independence from Britain in 1946. The continuation of 
Western dominance and white saviourism in Arabic-speaking countries is still 
widely apparent, especially in the aid industry (Nasser-Eddin and Abu-Assab  
2020). Researchers – especially white English-speaking and Oxford-affiliated 
like me – do not stand apart from the unequal and racialised privileges,

authority, and conditions of mobility in refugee aid and its differentiation 
between local, national and ‘expatriate’ staff. Researchers benefit from the 
research data collected and the authority humanitarian partners lend in the 
field, but often reciprocity is limited (Lewis et al. 2019). Advocating for refugee 
and aid workers’ perspectives, I also produced three field reports for 
Cash4Work and BasicAssistance outlining key dynamics affecting the pilot 
and people’s experiences with it over time. While acknowledging intractable 
power and positionality issues, I followed an intersectional ethics of care 
approach in addressing dynamics of marginalisation in the research, moder­
ating the discussions carefully, making space for people to speak in their own 
languages, and trying out exercises that could appeal to everyone (Leurs 2017; 
Raghuram 2019).
Conjuring the Blockchain Pilot
I. Confusion
As I sat in the Cash4Work van, chatting with three aid workers on one of 
my first journeys to Al-Za’atari in May 2018, Imane confidently told me 
she was ‘into blockchain’. When I asked her what she was into about 
blockchain, she said, ‘Blockchain is going to be the future, so we are getting 
there first. Blockchain means we are trying new things to improve our 
organisation’. For her, blockchain was synonymous with innovation and 
progress. Sitting beside her in the van was Nour, to whom I posed the same 
question. ‘Your knowledge, my knowledge (3alimy 3alimak). I’m not the 
right person to ask. I don’t know blockchain’, she replied. Farah, the third 
aid worker in the van, added, ‘Don’t ask me about blockchain either!’ To 
complete their everyday work, most Cash4Work staff did not need to 
understand how blockchain operated. Just as the camp staff did not feel 
obliged to know the inner workings of other payment systems Cash4Work 
used (such as prepaid cards or cash-in-hand), in-depth knowledge of 
blockchain was not necessary for their work and educating themselves 
would come at a high cost with no likely advantage. Ignorance in this 
sense – the delegation of knowing or acts of knowing elsewhere (to other 
objects or beings, experts, or institutions) – is a commonplace part of 
technical mediation (Mulvin 2021). Like other digital infrastructures that 
mediate payment such as VISA or SWIFT, the aid agencies’ blockchain 
network operated in the background. Its technical protocols were beyond 
common knowledge.2
2.While one would not expect field aid workers to know the inner workings of blockchain, one would expect for them 
to understand its practical implications and effectiveness for their work. What they need to know is whether it will 
effectively deliver the promised service. The issue is that they neither know for certain that it will work nor can they 
explain the mechanisms behind its potential success. This gap in knowledge hinders informed decision-making and 
leads to reliance on ignorance and trust rather than understanding and knowledge.

Classic studies of infrastructure stress their background-ness and invisibil­
ity; how socio-technical systems only become a subject of attention and debate 
in moments of breakdown or crisis (Star and Ruhleder 1996). Blockchain, 
however, was often discursively in the foreground even before it had a chance 
to break down or not. Most Cash4Work staff in the Jordan Country Office, 
like Nour and Farah, did not expect and were not expected to know about this 
backend database system in depth. Yet most expressed some level of confusion 
and anxiety about not-(yet)-knowing blockchain. Across this small organisa­
tion, the blockchain-related technicalities of the new pilot project were treated 
as an intimidating mystery, but often also laughed off as a slightly silly subject. 
Cash4Work staff consistently asserted their ignorance by using caveats, 
humorous deflections, and deferring to other colleagues perceived as more 
knowledgeable. One was Saif, an IT manager at Cash4Work. In a workshop 
prior to the pilot’s launch in the summer of 2019, Saif said: ‘I’m only here to 
learn, I don’t know anything about this blockchain thing’. Saif was a self- 
described ‘technical person’. Other staff considered him the expert on The 
Blockchain Pilot within the organisation and called on him when they had 
a question. Yet in a 1–1 meeting he told me, ‘Blockchain is very complicated. 
I don’t understand all the details. There is more I need to learn. Lakin [but]. . . 
we have developed the easy user interfaces for staff now, so thank God we 
don’t have to worry as much about how it works!’ It was unclear how much 
anyone (beyond the private companies that initially set up the solution) 
needed to understand. Cash4Work staff were well aware of the ambitious 
promotions of the pilot on the international stage as an important element of 
Cash4Work’s PR. They were highly self-conscious about blockchain’s 
unknowability, but this was also not their problem. For some aid professionals, 
the complexity of the new system and the confusion around blockchain 
fostered a sense of detachment from their actions.
The confusion about blockchain was shared by staff from across the partner 
organisations working on the pilot project. A Jordanian supermarket franchise 
provided cash liquidity in the camps for the refugees who received aid via 
blockchain. When I interviewed the franchise manager in 2018, expecting to 
discuss the logistics of the pilot in depth, he smiled, shaking his head: ‘Hey look, 
I don’t know anything about the blockchain yet, why don’t you ask someone 
else’, even though he had been involved in negotiating the pilot setup and 
contract with Cash4Work. Likewise, when I met BasicAssistance camp staff 
who worked with the refugee camp supermarkets and supermarket-goers to 
regulate the shop environment and pricings, they told me: ‘We don’t know 
about the blockchain, we haven’t understood what it’s all about!’ Across the 
30+ elite interviews I conducted online and internationally with aid industry 
experts, few participants spoke confidently about blockchain. In fact, several 
interviewees asked me to explain blockchain to them. In March 2021, Eliza, 
a consultant on cash coordination and tech who had written blogs and reports 
GEOPOLITICS
1083

--- Page 13 ---
about blockchain, said: ‘I still don’t know what the f*** blockchain is, where it is 
or what it looks like. How do you make one? How do you put something on it? 
The aha moment I’ve had recently is, oh, maybe I don’t have to understand it, 
maybe it will just turn into an app?’ Data management was usually a mundane, 
niche topic: blockchain made it interesting. She suggested that aid organisations 
were ‘jumping to blockchain’ because it was famous compared to the alternative 
options: ‘Most of us have never heard of a sequel [90s technology] database. And, 
like, we’re stuck on the 2003 version of Excel and always falling behind on 
security updates’.
Cash4Work staff were now expected to represent, buy into, and defend 
blockchain and The Blockchain Pilot, at conferences, in reports and press 
releases, on donor visits and at external events. Blockchain was in the dark, in 
the background, mysterious and hard to access, yet at the same time it was 
fully in the foreground as an incomprehensible and absurd signifier of the new 
and the futuristic, highly important and relevant, but a subject for someone 
else, somewhere else, to explain. Cash4Work and other aid professionals’ 
confusion was not unique or surprising, given the universal mystification, 
uncertainty, and bewilderment around blockchain. The Cash4Work Jordan 
team playfully but consistently refused to engage in discussion about block­
chain. This refusal can be understood as a muted challenge to the innovation 
agenda they were being enrolled in. Invoking their ignorance, humanitarian 
professionals highlighted the absurdity of applying high-tech innovations 
dreamed up elsewhere and beyond their understanding. Meanwhile, the con­
fusion was useful in the wider conjuring of the pilot. It allowed the pilot’s 
promotors to express leaps faith in the benefits blockchain could bring. The 
promotional claims were difficult to refute. To be refuted, they needed to be 
understood.
II. Illusion
Blockchain was treated as a conceptually elusive, magic technological object 
that could without clear explanation achieve an extensive range of desirable 
effects. In December 2018 I was involved in a brainstorming activity with 
the Cash4Work staff where they set out the objectives for the pilot. Nina, 
the Monitoring and Evaluation Lead, suggested: ‘As well as giving bene­
ficiaries more dignity, blockchain gives us more accuracy and oversight 
with who we are delivering the salaries to and makes the system more 
efficient than when we distributed bags of cash’. Cash4Work staff regularly 
conflated blockchain with features and properties of other, connected 
components of the pilot’s infrastructure – and even just the generic out­
comes of digitalisation. In Nina’s comment, blockchain was mistakenly 
equated with the ‘digital wallet’ concept (the idea of a savings account, 
considered more dignified for refugee women than cash), for biometric 
1084

identity verification (the system’s accuracy technology), and for any form of 
automation (improving cash handout efficiency over a paper-based system). 
None of these valued features actively required a blockchain. Similarly, 
a 2020 press release about the pilot reported that ‘Cash4Work’s innovative 
blockchain cash disbursement has proven to be a reliable and resilient 
system because it can be managed remotely’. This feature also does not 
require a blockchain. Purported benefits such as reliability, efficiency, and 
remote management (which became a priority in the COVID-19 pandemic) 
are features of automation – they do not require blockchain. Another kind 
of shared database would have been capable of making major cost savings 
(by reducing the transactions going through banks) and providing data 
transparency. It may well have been more expensive and complex to set up 
and run a blockchain rather than a simple database. The specific need for 
distributed ledger technology (the family of systems of which blockchain is 
part) was never argued in discussions with Cash4Work Jordan staff and 
their PR. The technical details were usually articulated by tech developers 
or BasicAssistance project staff, but they failed to convincingly justify the 
need for blockchain.
Aysha, one of the aid workers in Al-Za’atari and Al-Azraq camps, was 
cynical about the conflations some of her Cash4Work and BasicAssistance 
colleagues were making. At different points in my fieldwork, she pointed to the 
illusory quality of The Blockchain Pilot’s PR. For example, Aysha deflated the 
claim that the blockchain was enhancing ‘decentralised collaboration’ among 
aid agencies: ‘We already collaborated with a logistics agency before! The pilot 
just replaces that with new collaborators. Why does working with 
BasicAssistance count as innovation, but the logistics agency didn’t? Just 
because they are not using new tech?’ She was also cynical about the claim 
that The Blockchain Pilot was empowering refugee women:
The blockchain pilot might be good for the agencies but really it’s not for the refugees. 
This industry is a stage, and everyone has to act. The refugee women can only use this 
technology during the time they are working with us [on the cash-for-work scheme]. For 
most of them, that’s three or six months, then [because of camp policy] they will not be 
allowed to work again for a long time. They won’t use the technology. We know this 
really.7
Aysha suggested the benefits of using blockchain were always going to be 
asymmetric. There were clear advantages to the pilot when it came to cutting 
transaction fees. But, according to her, the pilot privileged reputational advan­
tages and new funding for the organisations at the expense of refugees’ needs 
and priorities. Some of blockchain’s promises were a convenient illusion. The 
Blockchain Pilot’s PR ignored a key factor which drastically reduced the 
possibilities for refugees’ meaningful financial inclusion in the longer term: 
the Jordanian authorities’ harsh labour restrictions in the camps which meant 
GEOPOLITICS
1085

--- Page 15 ---
that refugees could only work for short periods, with only one household 
member working at a time. Other aid professionals I interviewed echoed this 
cynicism. In January 2021, a digitalisation critic told me, ‘I don’t think it’s 
helpful to think “aid organisations good, companies bad”. In my experience, 
our sector cares as much if not more about the bottom line as the private sector 
does. It’s naïve to think it’s all about the beneficiary. It’s all about keeping the 
donor happy so the money doesn’t stop coming in’.
In Amman I met Hannah, a cash expert assisting aid agencies. For Hannah, 
the vague catchphrases animating the hype around blockchain were strategic 
to the technology’s (often white Western ‘tech bro’) vendors:
For a while blockchain was everywhere but I thought, do I have to understand this? Then 
I realised it was coming for me. I started going to events and there would be presenta­
tions, usually by white guys, about how women coffee growers in Uganda can be 
empowered by blockchain. But they would never explain how. They would say ‘because 
blockchain is decentralised’, and I’d be like, ‘I know that, but connect the dots for me!’
Hannah had been involved in creating a ‘decision tree’ for aid organisations 
where every question led to the answer ‘No, you probably don’t need 
a blockchain’.
III. Disappearance
Beyond strategic tactics like exaggeration and illusion, some forms of ignor­
ance accumulate when new tech is embedded in a social context. Ignorance 
can emanate from ‘impasses, errors, limitations and affordances of socio­
technical networks’ – which humans do not fully control – as an unintended 
side effect (Scheel 2024, 4). Analysing Cash4Work’s blockchain system and its 
socio-technical features highlights important disappearances: blind spots, 
erasures, and dislocations from knowledge that arose in the design and every­
day maintenance of the blockchain. These disappearances were shaped by 
power asymmetries between and within aid agencies. They played out in the 
specific configuration of this blockchain network: the node hosting, the data 
validation hierarchies, and the access to the blockchain ledger.
The job contracts of refugee camp staff were usually renewed on a rolling 
basis. They were temporary and precarious, in one of the lowest pay brackets 
within aid agencies. In Jordan, aid workers’ routines were unstable, involving 
hours of travelling each day, making phone calls in a van with patchy network 
connections, laptops jiggling on their laps. The camp staff were a motivated 
group, each pursuing part-time studies and keen to build their careers. Yet, 
one day in the Al-Azraq admin office, Aysha told me she was frustrated that 
the pilot didn’t bring her any technical skills development: ‘We are just 
working with Excel, same as always. We have nothing to do with the block­
chain’. Aysha’s perspective contrasted with the narrative put forward by Lina 
1086
M. CHEESMAN

--- Page 16 ---
and Imane in the workshops, that the blockchain pilot empowered not only 
refugees but Cash4Work staff in Jordan. Imane was also an aid worker, but she 
was named the ‘blockchain focal point’ and had a strong sense of ownership 
over the pilot. She represented it in press releases and on diplomatic visits to 
the camps. Participating in The Blockchain Pilot was rewarding and gave her 
status:
I am passionate about blockchain, but the mentality especially in South Jordan is still that 
people don’t believe women can do great things. My work with the blockchain in the 
camps proves them wrong.
Imane articulated her role in the pilot as part of her own personal attainment 
and professional empowerment as a woman from a conservative Muslim 
background. The technical aspect of working with blockchain and any issues 
she experienced in managing the pilot were less important than championing 
innovation and Cash4Work’s brand of international feminism. But Imane’s 
perspective was not generally shared by her colleagues. For Aysha, the block­
chain pilot re-inscribed the hierarchical politics of the Cash4Work Jordan 
office in its technical architecture. The proclaimed benefits of blockchain – 
real-time data and transparency – were not extended to aid workers. They 
could upload datasets to the blockchain interface, but they did not have any 
further access to information or the authority to amend data in the system:
If I could access the blockchain and get information about beneficiaries’ wallets and the 
status of their payments, I could answer their questions when they come to me at the 
Women’s Centre. But I can only upload data. I can’t edit the information I’ve uploaded 
once I’ve sent it. If a beneficiary tells me there is a mistake with her money, I can’t just 
correct it, I must go through the admin office staff. If something goes wrong, we [camp 
staff] have very little power in the organisation.
Cash4Work’s blockchain application was designed around a sequence of 
ranked, prescriptive data validation roles for selected Jordan staff. 
Cash4Work Jordan created its blockchain interface according to the segrega­
tion of duties and authority within their organisation. There were nine ‘users’ 
of this blockchain. Each individual user had a different level of access to data 
and authority in the system. This corresponded with the existing hierarchy of 
roles at Cash4Work. Once the five camp staff members uploaded their datasets 
to the blockchain interface, the Programme Associate verified the data. She 
worked with camp staff to resolve any glitches or incorrect data, which were 
flagged as ‘warnings’, and were usually caused by typos in the contract 
information (e.g., rate or length of refugees’ cash-for-work contracts). Once 
the data was submitted, the Finance Associate received an automated email 
(‘Dataset is parked, please review and post’) and visited the interface to sign off 
on (‘validate’) the information. Two other Cash4Work staff with higher levels 
of authority (‘Signatory Level 1’ and ‘Signatory Level 2’) would then also 
GEOPOLITICS
1087

--- Page 17 ---
validate the information before the total amount could be released to trigger 
the transfer of financial value to refugees’ digital wallets.
Cash4Work camp staff upheld (and sometimes held up, due to data entry 
errors) the system’s maintenance with their mundane spreadsheet work. But 
they were then made to disappear: aid workers had no direct engagement with 
the blockchain ledger itself and could not access the useful information it 
contained. They were more spectators or magicians’ assistants than players in 
the grand theatre of blockchain technology. Aid workers could only perform a 
limited range of tasks, like uploading spreadsheets. They were alienated by the 
strict, hierarchical pipeline they were asked to work along. They gained no new 
skills and had no meaningful involvement in blockchain design. They had lost 
the ability to know important information, relegating them to the same state of 
ignorance as the beneficiaries. As in other data infrastructure projects in 
postcolonial settings, The Blockchain Pilot’s design was shaped by the differ­
entially valued divisions of labour where engineering knowledge is connected 
to Western tech partners (Davies 2021). The hierarchical design of the block­
chain database enhanced the existing, systematic differentiation in aid orga­
nisations according to race, gender, class, status, authority, responsibility, pay, 
esteem, and proximity to suffering and danger (Benton 2016). Despite the 
promise of empowerment and transparency, aid workers found themselves 
constrained by an elusive system, the management and control of which was 
largely a mystery to them.
With the launch of The Blockchain Pilot, camp staff disappeared from the 
stage of humanitarian action as soon as they had filled in a spreadsheet of 
refugees’ names and sums to be credited. The setting for the making of the 
payments, which had previously been the Cash4Work Women’s Centres, 
shifted to the camp supermarket. Supermarket cashiers and biometric cameras 
replaced aid workers. When salary issues arose, refugees were compelled to 
seek assistance from the camp staff, who then had to undertake extra work by 
contacting the supermarkets or visiting them in person to investigate and 
resolve each issue individually. As Nour – a gender-based violence specialist 
and camp staff member – told me as she put down the phone with the Al- 
Azraq supermarket manager: ‘Sometimes there is confusion because the 
supermarket tells the beneficiaries we will handle a payment issue, but we 
tell them the supermarket needs to handle it. I must address it with them [store 
managers] on the phone. Often, I’m busy, so I send refugee administrators to 
find out what’s going on’. But her colleague Meriem suggested when we got 
back to the office, ‘Well, it’s not our problem anymore. Everything’s arranged 
from our side. It’s not our money to deliver, it’s theirs [the supermarkets] now. 
If it got trapped on the way, it’s not our problem’. Administrator Meriem had 
no qualms with Cash4Work delegating the humanitarian work and care, even 
though supermarket workers are not care specialists and have other priorities 
to manage. Nour and other camp staff did not agree with this sentiment. The 
1088

--- Page 18 ---
different views among Cash4Work staff about the confusion over responsi­
bility for solving refugees’ problems reflected the failure of blockchain to 
achieve a magical solution to issues of trust in transactions. Blockchain adop­
tion created new problems: it fostered the disappearance and diffusion of 
humanitarian responsibilities.
That day, at lunchtime I walked with Nour and a small group of refugee 
women to the camp supermarket. At the tills, we observed as women withdrew 
cash and asked the cashier questions, for example about their balance, or 
querying the amount, or about when the next payment from Cash4Work 
would come through. Rolling her eyes, Nour leaned over and said quietly in 
my ear: ‘Look, now the women ask their questions to the cashiers, but they’re 
just cashiers, they don’t know anything more about the salaries’. Sarcastically, 
she added: ‘Though they [the cashiers] obviously still give the women an 
answer. They won’t say they don’t know’. The supermarkets were usually 
hectic, and the cashiers inundated. The cashiers had received training about 
how to deliver the Cash4Work salaries. But it transpired that sometimes they 
would give misleading information rather than confess ignorance. Nour sug­
gested the biometric verification and transaction data on their screens were 
treated by cashiers as self-evident truth which refugees could not contest. The 
cashiers had the authority to withhold refugees’ access to money. The super­
market staff, naturally, did not uphold the humanitarian values of aid workers.
BasicAssistance led The Blockchain Pilot. More than Cash4Work, their 
prerogative was to spread and promote the network for global adoption,8 
and they dominated technical decision-making and network management. 
In 
collaboration 
with 
blockchain 
companies 
and 
consultants, 
BasicAssistance’s Blockchain Team designed the blockchain governance fra­
mework, which meant they delineated what decisions should go ‘on or off 
chain’ (i.e., what components of the payment system should be automated), 
how technical issues should be resolved, how consensus algorithms should be 
formulated, how vendors are selected and vetted or members incorporated, 
and more. At the start of the pilot, BasicAssistance’s authority over the 
database system was encoded in a very material way: they ‘hosted’ 
Cash4Work’s node. In other words, Cash4Work had limited ownership and 
control over the device used to verify and record transactions, and therefore 
participate in the blockchain network. Fouad told me in July 2019:
We have different types of ID numbers to BasicAssistance because we serve individuals 
and they serve households,9 and somehow, we couldn’t work it out yet, so for now we are 
just using BasicAssistance’s node and testing different scenarios until we launch our 
own.
Disappearances happened in the conjuring of this technocratic pilot. To create 
the illusion that the project was functioning effectively, Cash4Work vanished 
as a real blockchain partner in practice, for a mix of human resources and 
GEOPOLITICS
1089

--- Page 19 ---
technical reasons. The node hosting arrangement signified the ultimate 
authority of BasicAssistance over the ‘shared’ blockchain. BasicAssistance 
originally designed this blockchain system to be locally ‘customisable’ and it 
was co-owned with Cash4Work. However, the costs of entry, necessary 
resources, and expertise involved in designing, building, and running a node 
on the network were very high. No Cash4Work staff in Jordan had experience 
in blockchain smart contracts, cryptography, and distributed ledger design. 
Lina pointed out, ‘We are only a small organisation and not super strong with 
data management’. In an expert interview with an aid industry consultant, 
Jennifer, she suggested Cash4Work Jordan were following a risky and expen­
sive ‘out with the old, in with the new’ strategy:
Unless agencies start employing more coders, no organisation has enough blockchain 
expertise. It’s not sustainable. Who are these people going to be that manage blockchain 
committees but also understand how technical decisions have bearings in the field?
Blockchains are not always designed and maintained as equitable, peer-to-peer 
infrastructures. The Blockchain Pilot instituted a neoliberal grey area where 
new problems for aid workers and refugees emerged as private companies, 
automated processes, and blockchain experts came to dominate previously 
interpersonal humanitarian work. Cash4Work camp staff in Jordan were not 
meaningfully upskilled, they fell out of sight from the system, and the block­
chain ledger was invisible to them. The disappearances involved in conjuring 
The Blockchain Pilot highlight how the production and circulation of ignor­
ance is not just a matter of wilful human action. Ignorance was not simply a 
result of deceptive market creation—humanitarian agencies pursuing politi­
cal-economic gain, conspiring to exclude aid workers. Disappearances resulted 
from the combined effects of socio-technical practices: data validation, node 
hosting, and ledger access. These practices were linked to pre-existing institu­
tional hierarchies and constraints.
IV. Misdirection
Lina, the head of Cash4Work’s programmes, was frank about unknowns 
(meaning the future results of the pilot), which was not the same as not- 
knowing. In the December 2018 multi-stakeholder workshop, she said 
candidly, ‘Blockchain’s value proposition for beneficiaries may not match 
up in comparison to the cost savings, so we need to see if that weighs up 
once the pilot launches’. She referred to the analysis from field reports 
I had shared with Cash4Work based on my research in the camps. Refugee 
women had reported that the new setting for withdrawing cash (biometric 
cameras, supermarket cashiers) was far less comfortable and appropriate 
than the Cash4Work Women’s Centres. John from BasicAssistance’s 
Europe-based innovation hub, the Disrupt Programme, responded, ‘But 
1090
M. CHEESMAN

--- Page 20 ---
we all know that innovation goes through sprints and iterations, you just 
have to keep assessing the whole range of costs and benefits and adapting 
on that basis. The cost savings and efficiency with blockchain are huge’. 
Using blockchain as an alternative accounting system meant rerouting the 
agency’s (donor) funds around local banks and therefore drastically redu­
cing transaction fees on aid transfers (now nearly zero). Lina and her team 
agreed. They suggested resistance to change and ‘teething problems’ were 
a natural and inevitable part of innovation that would affect refugees and 
Cash4Work staff, and that ‘packaging the pilot as innovation helps with the 
risk of failure’.
Conjuring The Blockchain Pilot as a product on the donor marketplace 
involved diverting attention away from its emerging, negative effects on the 
people it aimed to help. In press releases and professional events, attention was 
directed towards quantitative metrics (cost effectiveness, speed and volume of 
transactions) and illusions about blockchain’s unique selling points (transpar­
ency and reliability, refugee women’s dignity) – as discussed above. Lina and 
her team were aware of the pilot’s questionable impacts on refugees, but 
willing to wait and see how refugees’ responses balanced against 
Cash4Work’s KPIs (key performance indicators) and their bottom line. As 
Aysha had suggested, conjuring blockchain’s empowering impacts involved 
misdirection: overlooking important knowledge about camp policy and refu­
gees’ priorities and preferences. The misleading promotions and jargon sur­
rounding blockchain applications in the Global South have been critiqued as a 
‘neocolonial tactic of bamboozlement’, part of a strategy of ‘deregulation that 
reaches back into the imperial core’ (Jutel 2023).
Misdirection was justified by the aid agencies’ approach to refugee women’s 
own knowledge and understanding as in deficit. Nina, Cash4Work’s 
Monitoring and Evaluation Lead, suggested: ‘Women will have a phase of 
confusion, but going forward, they will be more knowledgeable, aware and 
accepting of the process’. Later, in a workshop after the pilot’s launch, she 
suggested issues with the pilot were arising from some refugees ‘not under­
standing’. Many refugee women workers were concerned that the rhythm of 
payments had changed from monthly to weekly, which was convenient for the 
digital wallet design, but not for their household financial management.10 
Nina said they ‘didn’t understand the concept of weekly’. Cash4Work hosted 
my research, supported my camp access, engaged with the workshops, inter­
views, and ongoing results. At the same time, my fieldwork was curtailed by 
senior agency staff marginalising refugee women’s initial responses to the 
pilot – failing or choosing not to see and hear them. When I was negotiating 
my fieldwork dates with Cash4Work, Lina asked that I not conduct research in 
the Women’s Centres until three months after the new blockchain system had 
been in place: ‘We know already beneficiaries aren’t keen on the pilot simply 
because it will bring change. They need some time to get used to it, then let’s 
GEOPOLITICS
1091

gather feedback’. When I was writing up a report in early 2020, Alex from 
BasicAssistance asked me to ‘measure what’s normal resistance to change, and 
what are genuine problems arising from blockchain’. He requested:
You need to isolate the technical achievement from the implementation [. . .] It’s good to 
get the refugees’ impressions, but then there are also hard metrics. Like, the transaction 
processing times and how they are vastly reduced. That’s facilitated by and also captured 
with the blockchain. Again, I think it will be important to convert perception to reality.
Alex was effectively asking me to detach the name of blockchain and The 
Blockchain Pilot from any issues arising from the pilot in Jordan’s camps. 
Blockchain was cast in this scenario as a neutral transparency provider. What 
it had to say was more reliable than the project’s end users. The Blockchain 
Pilot was preserved as an untouchable product, beyond criticism, by denying 
the validity of refugees’ claims and perspectives on system change.
Mirroring aid professionals’ deficit approach to refugees and their 
knowledge claims, expatriate staff sometimes type-cast Cash4Work’s 
Jordan staff working in the camps – nearly all Arab women – with the 
orientalist trope of slowness and backwardness (Sukarieh and Tannock  
2019, p. 393). John, a British ‘expat’ from the BasicAssistance Disrupt 
Programme told me he had been trying to get Cash4Work Jordan staff to 
finalise their procurement of private contracts before the pilot’s launch: 
‘The problems with getting the pilot off the ground are a combination of 
slow bureaucratic processes, but also a lack of real technical skill and 
initiative and understanding to get it done. Basically, nobody here knows 
what they’re doing’. Aid workers were critical of Western partners’ dom­
inance in the pilot. Imane quipped: ‘The BasicAssistance brand is like 
Nike – just do it. Foreigners are treated with privilege by senior staff. 
They have perfect English. Even we Jordanians assume they will be better, 
more professional, and knowledgeable. It will be less effort and resources 
training them’. At one multi-stakeholder workshop, John had contested 
Cash4Work staff’s – and my – use of the name of their organisation in 
association with the Cash4Work Jordan pilot. He suggested:
‘Our technology is separate from the service delivery. This blockchain is ready to go. We 
don’t want to be responsible for any issues that arise with Cash4Work’s service delivery 
in Jordan’.
John positioned this blockchain as separate from social complexity. Like Alex, 
he was alarmingly upfront about preserving the reputation of The Blockchain 
Pilot. Any failure would be down to Cash4Work Jordan’s implementation, not 
the blockchain per se. Whereas the agencies had been promoting blockchain as 
the basis for social change, it now appeared that if the promised change failed 
to take place, or undesirable outcomes emerged, then blockchain could not be 
blamed. Conveniently, blockchain could both bring about refugee 
1092

empowerment and humanitarian efficiency and have no effects at all in the 
case of liability and reputational risk. The blockchain network (controlled by 
BasicAssistance) was both openly available for expert adaptation and its only 
partner, Cash4Work Jordan, was ill equipped to adapt it.
Misdirection served strategic aid industry interests, in this case the 
actors involved in conceiving and driving The Blockchain Pilot: Basic 
Assistance’s EU-based Disrupt Programme; the US and Europe-based 
headquarters of BasicAssistance and Cash4Work; the Western govern­
ments and other donors that funded the pilot; plus the biometrics com­
pany, the blockchain developers, and the supermarket companies and 
their corporate social responsibility agendas. Misdirection – moving atten­
tion away from the social impacts of a pilot to preserve the miraculous 
purity of the technology – could be the sign of a true blockchain believer. 
But ignorance is not always only a decided, cynical political strategy of 
deception by ‘those in the know’ towards ‘those who do not know’. It also 
served local actors’ interests: Cash4Work Jordan and its staff ultimately 
benefited from the recognition, funding, and opportunities generated by 
the pilot too. In a subsequent workshop, participants were discussing how 
The Blockchain Pilot was about ‘access to information’ and aid agencies’ 
ability to target aid. Lina probed, ‘But that’s a risk for Cash4Work, being 
leveraged by BasicAssistance for our data’. John retorted: ‘I would hope 
not, it should be quid pro quo. You are using us for data too’. Lina 
replied: ‘Well, mainly we are using you for the free tech’. In the conjuring 
of this innovation pilot, who was in the know, and who was using who, 
was far from clear cut.
Discussion and Conclusion
It must not be assumed that magicians [. . .] disbelieve their own magic. They may have 
a limited professional cynicism about it, from knowing how some of the tricks are done. 
But fundamentally they are involved, with the rest of the society, in the confusion to 
which the magical gestures are a response. Magic is always an unsuccessful attempt to 
provide meanings and values, but it is often very difficult to distinguish magic from 
genuine knowledge.
Raymond Williams, Advertising: The Magical System, p. 137
Humanitarian aid organisations conjure innovation products to attract 
and maintain their funding sources and reputations. Ignorance and 
ignorance-making is part of this process: true belief and expertise in 
the technology mingles with confusion, uncertainty, doubt, and decep­
tion. Knowledge and ignorance are dynamically related and connected 
with power. The ignorance of some can still ‘conjure’ blockchain and 
The Blockchain Pilot, while the ignorance of others is deemed deficient. 
GEOPOLITICS

The subjugation and neglect of particular actors and knowledge forms as 
less reliable or credible are key institutional tactics of domination in 
migration management settings (Aradau 2021; Aradau and Perret 2022; 
Tazzioli 2022). As we have seen, refugees’ ‘impressions’ of technological 
change are rendered deficient, but the ‘spectacle’ of the pilot still justifies 
the roll-out of blockchain, even when the most valued outcomes of the 
pilot (cost effectiveness, data transparency) did not require blockchain 
technology.
Blockchain, which emerged as a challenge to powerful authorities, is 
depoliticised. New middlemen become essential nodes in the payment 
network, marginalising aid workers. The foothold this blockchain network 
gives to profit motivated actors potentially threatens humanitarian inde­
pendence; this biometrics company is involved in upholding mobility 
control and national security interests in authoritarian Jordan. Aid orga­
nisations’ turn to remote management and subcontracting has been cri­
tiqued as ‘welfare abandonment’ as humanitarian actors and principles 
gradually disappear from humanitarian spaces (Duffield 2016, 148). 
Replacing local knowledge and relationships, transactional surveillance 
and data informatics are meant to ‘recoup the distance’ (ibid). Some 
professionals embraced the delegation of humanitarian work. Others, 
mainly aid workers in the camps, contested the abdication of moral 
responsibilities. But they had scant power.
The assumption that ideas, developments, and processes originate from 
the Global North, while the South is on the receiving end and can only 
negotiate, appropriate, and/or resist is pervasive (İşleyen and Qadim  
2023). Powerful ‘global’ or multinational organisations (and their public 
and private partners) are seen to ‘lead’ innovation; research does not need 
to engage with the supposed ‘followers’, the heterogenous actors using and 
making blockchain in practice. This replicates the positioning of local 
humanitarian staff and refugees as passive recipients of ‘top down’ pater­
nalistic aid projects. It perpetuates the fetishisation of blockchain as 
a ready-made, revolutionary solution. Yet aid workers play a primary 
role in co-constituting the outcomes of humanitarian projects (Gatter  
2023; Musmar 2017). Paternalistic relations and epistemic subjugation 
are not always binaristic (North vs South) and they do not create crude 
victims. Local and regional actors also legitimise the so-called Arab world 
as a space for intervention and capital (Carpi 2019; Hanafi 2019). 
Cash4Work aid professionals played the game: thanks to the ignorance 
surrounding blockchain, they made and upheld the ambitious promises of 
The Blockchain Pilot. This gameplay supported the pilot’s disruption of 
everyday work and relationships for Cash4Work staff and refugees for the 
sake of cost savings, free tech, donations, and PR. Ultimately, ignorance 
has instrumental value. The blockchain experiment is only possible when

certain knowledges are favoured (quantified effectiveness measures, inno­
vation engineering) while others (refugees’ and aid workers’ priorities and 
expertise) are neglected and abandoned. Aid workers kept their sceptical 
distance from the blockchain pilot, not only through outright critique of 
what it overlooked, ignored, and conflated, but also through playful 
rejections of blockchain as a subject worth knowing.
The lens of ‘conjuring’ contributes to understanding the practices of 
ignorance-making in technology governance, in and beyond migration 
management. Infrastructure projects like The Blockchain Pilot are ani­
mated by manufactured forms of ignorance. The illusion of blockchain’s 
magic is upheld by aid professionals. General confusion about the tech­
nology plays into the spectacle. Misdirection diverts attention from the 
harmful consequences of disruptive innovation. Conveniently, block­
chain brings about refugee empowerment and humanitarian efficiency 
and has no effects at all in the case of liability and reputational risk. At 
the same time, ‘conjuring’ does not just involve secret behind-the-scenes 
plans. Magicians sometimes believe their own magic. Disappearances 
accumulate inadvertently through the design of innovations. Here, 
some people and forms of knowledge vanish from the socio-technical 
system, linked to organisational hierarchies. Highlighting the role of 
ignorance in struggles around access and exclusion, power and account­
ability, this research advances theories of ‘conjuring’ in social studies of 
markets. Conjurings in capitalist markets do not just work on perfor­
mances, spectacles, and appearances, expertise, and true belief. They 
involve and require disappearances, misdirection, illusion, and confu­
sion. It is not only in refugee camps that the conjuring of innovation 
products trumps meaningful value to the people involved, and block­
chain will not be the last of its kind.
Notes
1. The pilot is promoted as a ‘financial inclusion’ project for refugee women: it helps them 
develop digital literacy and money management skills and supports their financial 
independence and security. Gender-based violence is a pressing issue faced by some 
refugee women workers enrolled in the Cash4Work scheme. An iris-scan-protected 
digital wallet is imagined to be safer from the predation of men than physical cash.
2. Controversial examples include Bitcoin, which – like other ‘proof-of-work’ blockchains – 
demands significant computing power, energy consumption, and electronic waste, and 
the corruption scandal surrounding FTX (formerly one of the largest cryptocurrency 
exchanges) which went bankrupt and collapsed in 2022.
3. I explain the technical architecture in more detail below (Section III: Disappearance), 
and the roles of the key actors, Cash4Work, BasicAssistance, and their partners.
4. In immigration diplomacy, refugees are ‘bargaining chips’ as rich metropoles seek to 
outsource the responsibilities of refugee protection and care to low-income countries

(Walia 2021, 4). Humanitarian labour and funding are chiefly distributed among 
historically marginalised, dispossessed countries in the Global South – in the case of 
the Syrian crisis, among Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh and Daley  
2019). Wealthier governments and aid agencies in the Global North (the European 
Union, the World Bank) facilitate South-South ‘burden-sharing’ by giving grants, 
loans, and preferential trade agreements. This supports regional stability and sustainable 
development in the Middle East, but also their financial interests and asylum policies 
(externalisation and hostility to migration) (ibid). Through innovative governance 
strategies and initiatives, Jordan in particular has become ‘a laboratory and a showcase 
for a new global blueprint for economic development in refugee hosting states, thereby 
attempting to marshal the unused “human capital” of refugees’ (Lenner and Turner  
2019, 12).
5. Humanitarian agencies have always collaborated with businesses to purchase supplies or 
secure funding. But the more recent innovative turn does not just forge temporary 
alliances: ‘it adopts, wholesale, the priorities, language and worldview of the private 
sector’. (Scott-Smith 2016, p. 2242).
6. This was part of an extended study which involved research with end-user communities, 
refugee women, as well as aid industry decision makers and tech designers.
7. For an account of refugee end-users’ evaluations of blockchain-based aid, see 
‘Cheesman, M. (forthcoming). On being financialised: “Mish baraka” or aid recipients’ 
critique of a blockchain pilot’ and ‘Blockchain for Refugees’ (Cheesman 2022a). Here, 
refugee women critique the pilot as disrupting and depleting their socio-economic 
resources, relationships, and routines. Blockchain’s promises (data privacy, transparent 
accounting, frictionless transactions) fall down: women lack trust in the technology and 
find public cash withdrawals uncomfortable. Without access to the ledger, they keep 
track of their finances with paper receipts and tallies. The blockchain-based payments 
disrupt their debt repayment schedules.
8. This blockchain network now operates in several other countries and humanitarian 
settings around the world.
9. To authorise transactions, blockchains deploy public and private keys, pairs of long 
numbers corresponding to the identity credentials of individuals. The UN agencies’ 
different beneficiary types brought major technical challenges relating to private key 
management. Each of the agencies are custodians of beneficiaries’ private keys, and they 
cannot share the keys with each other for privacy reasons and so that one agency cannot 
spend another’s money. Much technical development was required to allow the 
Cash4Work and BasicAssistance digital identities assigned to group and individual 
beneficiaries to correspond with one another in a secure way.
