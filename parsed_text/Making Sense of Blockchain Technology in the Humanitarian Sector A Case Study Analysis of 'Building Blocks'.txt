ABSTRACT 
 
Humanitarian Blockchain 
Refugee Camps 
 
Due to the decentralised, distributed and immutable nature of blockchain 
technology, several benefits arise, such as efficiency, transparency and 
accountability. Hence, humanitarian organisations began exploring 
blockchain technology, for instance, to monitor aid funding or improve 
financial inclusion. However, the implications of humanitarian blockchain are 
still academically and practically not profoundly understood. The question 
arises as to how the implementation of blockchain technology shapes the 
humanitarian sector beyond technical challenges. In light of the different 
theoretical perspectives on humanitarian blockchain, this paper analyses and 
discusses the blockchain-based solution ‘Building Blocks’ initiated by the 
World Food Programme (WFP) to facilitate aid allocation and eliminate 
transaction costs in refugee camps. The paper concludes that humanitarian 
blockchain is not only a socio-technical tool that must be analysed in its 
context but can be seen as an institutional technology shaping governance and 
power structures. Thus, humanitarian blockchain has the potential to 
fundamentally transform the humanitarian sector. 
1. Introduction  
Blockchain technology has gained notable 
interest among researchers and practitioners 
in the past several years. It has mostly been in 
the hype-cycle of media based on the 
speculative cryptocurrency market and the 
potential to disrupt the financial sector  (Ko & 
Verity, 2016). Initially focused on the 
economic benefits of blockchain, the attention 
is now shifting towards applications to tackle 
public, environmental and social issues. For 
instance, the local government of Estonia has 
increased research resources on blockchain 
applications for public record-keeping and 
voting systems (Ko & Verity, 2016).  
 
The variety of use cases for blockchain 
technology has also underlined the potential to 
improve accountability and transparency in 
the humanitarian aid and development sector 
(Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020). In 
fact, 
blockchain 
technology 
has 
been 
increasingly 
explored 
by 
humanitarian 
agencies, such as United Nations, High 
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), World 
Food Programme (WFP) and UN Women 
(Hunt et al., 2022; Kewell et al., 2017; 
Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020).  
 
Use cases being explored range from tracking 
logistical and service processes, distributing 
and monitoring aid funding (e.g., Disberse) to 
securing land registries (e.g., Bitland) and 
protecting data storing and sharing among 
humanitarian stakeholders to foster trust and 
fight corruption (Demir et al., 2020; 
International Committee of the Red Cross, 
2020; Sahebi et al., 2020). In addition, 
blockchain technology is implemented to 
create and verify digital identities to improve 
financial inclusion, for example, by allowing 
women access micro-loans (Kewell et al., 
2017; Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). 
Most of the existing literature on humanitarian 
12

iS 
blockchain, however, focuses on blockchain 
in humanitarian supply chain management, 
improving logistical processes that enable 
effective and fast aid allocation (Baharmand, 
Maghsoudi, et al., 2021; Dubey et al., 2020; 
Masudin et al., 2021). 
 
Despite 
the 
potential, 
humanitarian 
blockchain is still a nascent topic and not well 
understood from an academic standpoint. The 
first comprehensive framework to design a 
humanitarian 
blockchain 
project 
taking 
multiple stakeholders into account was 
developed only recently by Hunt et al. (2022). 
Additionally, most of the projects are in an 
early ideational stage and have not yet found 
application in the field. 
 
Further, 
several 
scholars 
criticise 
humanitarian blockchain as Silicon Valley 
solutionism which underlines the topic’s 
controversy. Jutel et al. (2022), for instance, 
state that Blockchain can be seen as ‘platform 
imperialism’ that builds on the cultural and 
economic power of geopolitical interests. 
Moreover, 
the 
two 
main 
caveats 
in 
implementing blockchain technology in 
humanitarian management are internet access 
and a stable infrastructure (Ko & Verity, 
2016; Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). 
Blockchain is associated with high energy 
consumption and requires a stable internet 
connection to process transactions. Therefore, 
in areas with poor energy infrastructure and 
where the internet is often shut down for 
various 
reasons, 
the 
technology 
will 
eventually reach the limits of scalability (Ko 
& Verity, 2016). 
 
In this paper, I argue that blockchain 
technology 
has 
vast 
implications 
for 
humanitarian management beyond technical 
challenges. While blockchain technology is 
not a panacea for all development ill, it 
requires more profound studies. Therefore I 
will explore the following research question: 
How does the implementation of blockchain 
technology shape the humanitarian sector? 
To answer this research question, I examine 
blockchain technology in light of the 
blockchain project ‘Building Blocks’ initiated 
by the World Food Programme. 
 
The paper is structured as follows. The next 
section 
presents 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
functionality of blockchain technology and 
how humanitarian blockchain is studied in 
literature. In section 3, I provide an in-depth 
outline of the case study ‘Building Blocks’. 
Next, I analyse how the implementation of 
blockchain 
technology 
is 
shaping 
humanitarian 
management 
and 
in 
the 
following chapter, reflect on the findings in 
light of the beforementioned theoretical 
perspectives on humanitarian blockchain. In 
the last section, I conclude the paper with 
further remarks. 
 
2. Literature Background: Humanitarian 
Blockchain 
 
Blockchain relies on distributed ledger 
technology and is a transactional database 
shared among multiple entities, for instance, 
NGOs, local governments and medical service 
providers (Hunt & Jun Zhuang, 2022; 
Pedersen et al., 2019). Within a blockchain 
network, 
multiple 
nodes 
operate 
collaboratively to secure and maintain 
immutable, shared, verifiable and accessible 
transaction records (Khan et al., 2021). The 
essential element of blockchain is eliminating 
the need for centralised trusted intermediaries. 
Therefore, multiple scholars mention benefits 
for the humanitarian sector, such as lower 
transaction costs and faster transaction times 
and increased transparency (International 
Committee of the Red Cross, 2020; Ko & 
Verity, 2016).  
 
Blockchain technology is built on a consensus 
protocol synchronising all nodes in the 
network and thus ensuring traceability of the 
records leading to strengthened accountability 
between involved entities. The consensus 
protocol is the governance mechanism of the 
blockchain, which can be either public or 
private. The main difference resides in 
identifying the pool of nodes that can 
participate and make administrative changes 
to the network (Pedersen et al., 2019). In a 
13

L.Perlitt / iSCHANNEL 17(1): 12-19 
 
public blockchain, anyone can access and 
participate (e.g. Bitcoin), which makes the 
network highly secure, but lacks privacy 
(Pedersen et al., 2019). Within a private 
blockchain, 
however, 
the 
access 
and 
participation are controlled and customized by 
specific 
entities. 
Since 
consensus 
is 
determined within the network, is more 
difficult for external entities to confirm the 
authenticity of the transactions (Pedersen et 
al., 2019). 
 
Multiple scholars have assessed the use of 
blockchain technology in the humanitarian 
sector. Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux (2018) 
analyse 
blockchain 
in 
humanitarian 
management as a tool with its unique benefits 
and challenges and stress that the design of the 
humanitarian 
blockchain 
should 
be 
considered as an outcome of intentional 
choices (Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). 
Based on the affordance theory, Kewell et al. 
(2017) 
examine 
how 
blockchain 
can 
contribute to the development goals and 
consider that the implementation is not purely 
a technical question but should also be seen in 
its social and political context. Baharmand et 
al. (2021) also identify that the most critical 
barriers are not because of technical issues. 
The authors establish a framework for 
designing humanitarian blockchain projects 
and 
differentiate 
between 
context-, 
technology- 
and 
organisational 
related 
requirements.  
 
Another 
perspective 
is 
adopted 
by 
Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal (2020). The 
authors 
underline 
the 
implications 
of 
blockchain technology on governance and 
power structures within the humanitarian 
sector. This view is in line with the paper by 
Davidson et al. (2018). The authors claim that 
blockchain is more than just a disruptive 
technological innovation. Blockchain can be 
considered as institutional technology of 
governance that allows for new types of 
organisations to disrupt existing power 
structures (Davidson et al., 2018). 
 
Lastly, while Hunt et al. (2022) emphasise the 
potential of blockchain with regard to 
collaboration and knowledge sharing between 
multiple disaster relief organisations, McIssac 
et al. (2019) specifically examine the potential 
of blockchain technology for refugee relief 
operations. The authors highlight how the 
benefits of blockchain in aid allocation and 
refugee 
identification 
will 
change 
humanitarian relief work fundamentally. 
Due to its unique characteristics, such as 
immutability and decentralisation resulting in 
increased transparency and accountability, 
blockchain technology is an interesting 
technology to explore in the humanitarian 
sector. Humanitarian blockchain in literature 
is mainly addressed from a socially-embedded 
perspective, taking the application’s context 
into account. Only a few authors, however, 
have taken a first step to explore the 
implications of blockchain technology in the 
humanitarian sector across the board of 
multiple actors. In this paper, I explore this 
issue in more depth through the analysis and 
discussion of the case study below. 
 
3. Case Study: ‘Building Blocks’ 
To overcome the expensive transaction and 
currency exchange fees when providing 
people in need with cash transfers, the World 
Food Programme (WFP) started its first 
blockchain-based pilot project in Pakistan to 
provide cash for 100 individuals without 
financial intermediaries in 2017. Today, 
‘Building Blocks’ is the world’s largest 
blockchain-based project for humanitarian 
assistance, currently active in two countries 
targeting over one hundred thousand refugees. 
‘Building Blocks’ was leveraged to support 
the increasing number of Syrian refugees at 
the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan and the 
Rohingya refugees in the ‘world’s largest 
refugee camp’ in Cox’s Bazar (Betts et al., 
2015; World Food Programme (WFP), 2022).  
 
In response to a crisis, several humanitarian 
organisations assist and improve the lives of 
affected and marginalised individuals with 
food, shelter or education programmes. Based 
14

iS 
on 
private, 
permissioned 
blockchain 
technology, the ‘Building Blocks’ network 
enables secure access and delivery of multiple 
types 
of 
assistance 
from 
different 
humanitarian organisations via one access 
point 
according 
to 
refugees’ 
personal 
priorities (Hunt & Jun Zhuang, 2022). With 
‘Building Blocks’, it is possible to track the 
help and services provided, offering an 
overview of where assistance is still required, 
reducing redundant efforts, and eventually 
increasing the well-targeted support (World 
Food 
Programme 
(WFP), 
2022). 
The 
blockchain-based solution is linked to an 
optical biometric authentication technology 
called ‘EyesPay’. To access assistance and 
cash vouchers at the local supermarket, 
refugees’ digital identities, also stored on the 
blockchain, are checked based on a retina 
scanner (Russ Juskalian, 2018).  
 
To this date, ‘Building Blocks’ has processed 
over 15 million transactions and thus saved 
over 2.5 million dollar bank fees (World Food 
Programme (WFP), 2022). Because of the 
success, ‘Building Blocks’ was also used in 
the aftermath of the explosion in Beirut, 
Lebanon, in 2020, where US$ 56 million in 
assistance was distributed (World Food 
Programme (WFP), 2022).   
 
4. Analysis 
As mentioned in section 2, the main 
characteristic of blockchain is decentralisation 
resulting in trustworthy and secure networks. 
‘Building Blocks’, however, is built on private 
permissioned blockchains (Programme, 2017; 
Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020). While 
some scholars argue that the use of private 
permissioned blockchains limits the potential 
of disruptive blockchain technology, more 
interestingly, it raises the question of the 
responsibility of  oversight and governance 
over the network and stored data (Thylin & 
Duarte, 
2019). 
Private 
permissioned 
blockchains are closed networks where 
designated actors participate in consensus 
validation only partially decentralised among 
known actors. WFP claims on their website 
that ‘the network is neutral without a 
hierarchy 
of 
ownership’ 
(World 
Food 
Programme (WFP), 2022). However, this can 
only be achieved if multiple organisations 
across several countries embed various 
databases and collaborate to create a 
decentralised 
peer-to-peer 
network 
of 
consensus. As long as the WFP operates the 
blockchain-based solution alone, it has power 
over all smart contracts established for cash 
transfer and records stored and added to the 
blockchain, increasing the risk of corruption 
and decreasing the blockchain characteristic 
of immutability (Baharmand, Saeed, et al., 
2021). The benefits of transparency and 
accountability toward outside oversight can 
not be ensured. Consequently, one could 
argue that ‘Building Blocks’ is not far from 
previous solutions and could have been solved 
with traditional databases (Programme, 2017). 
 
In 2019, UN Women was the first other 
humanitarian organisation to join the project 
and thus added another independent node to 
the network (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). 
Moreover, based on the example of ‘Building 
Blocks’ in the aftermath of the explosion in 
Lebanon, more humanitarian organisations 
are working together to create a more 
extensive network of independent nodes and, 
therefore, enhance the consensus mechanism. 
However, the problem remains that power and 
control continue to be locked in certain 
humanitarian 
silos 
(Programme, 
2017). 
Therefore, the power of certain actors is not 
necessarily removed but shifted from actors, 
such as local banks, to specific humanitarian 
organisations. 
 
Further, it is essential to note that the 
implemented technology cannot be reduced to 
blockchain alone, it has to be analysed as an 
assembly 
of 
technologies, 
including 
biometrics, blockchain and AI (Madianou, 
2019a). To verify their identity, refugees have 
to store their biometrical information in the 
form of digital identities, which allow WFP to 
track their actions. Besides risks, such as 
potential false matches, and ethical issues, 
such 
as 
concerns 
about 
beneficiaries’ 
perceptions, there is an increasing risk of 
15

--- Page 5 ---
 
 
L.Perlitt / iSCHANNEL 17(1): 12-19 
 
surveillance of malicious actors capitalising 
on the technology as an element of control and 
function creep (International Committee of 
the Red Cross, 2020). Hence, there will 
always be a trade-off between deploying such 
technologies and potentially reducing barriers 
to actors exploiting the system and using it for 
non-humanitarian purposes. 
 
On the same note, blockchain technology is 
not entirely secure due to its novelty. There 
may be issues in the ‘Building Blocks’ 
network that are currently unknown to WFP 
and could be potentially exploited and 
misused (Programme, 2017). These issues are 
not negligible and need to be directly 
addressed by humanitarian organisations 
working with blockchain-based solutions, in 
particular, taking into account that data stored 
on the blockchain contains sensitive data with 
identifiable information and belongs to a 
highly vulnerable population (Bricout & 
Aurez, 2020). 
 
Lastly, blockchain could shift the power to 
specific actors in the humanitarian sector or 
even add new players to the field. Due to the 
complexity of the technology, there is a risk of 
a gap in technical literacy (Sahebi et al., 
2020). It was reported that ‘Building Blocks’ 
lacked guidelines or training on using the 
technology (Ko & Verity, 2016). Non-experts, 
either refugees or humanitarian relief workers, 
could be disempowered because of their lack 
of understanding which is often also related to 
misconceptions and myths. While at the same 
time, more technically savvy people, such as 
coders and those with high mining capacity, 
are empowered, resulting in new unbalanced 
power structures. The argument is linked to 
the fact that ‘Building Blocks’ are developed 
in a top-down approach like most blockchain 
projects (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). NGOs, 
governments and big tech corporations come 
together to innovate. However, it is often 
disregarded if those novel innovations will be 
accepted by the people being exposed to the 
change and involved challenges. Hackathons, 
for example, can be seen as ‘techno 
solutionism’ stemming from a performative 
entrepreneurial approach and creating a 
potential dependence on existing platforms 
and technologies, often discussed in the 
debate on digital humanitarnism (Jutel, 2022). 
 
5. Discussion 
As described in the case study, ‘Building 
Blocks’ has many beneficial implications, 
including 
enhanced 
efficiency 
and 
transparency. However, although the project 
was initially set up to increase access to 
financial resources without the need for banks 
and therefore, reduce transaction costs, it has 
broader implications for the humanitarian 
sector.  
Hence, it is a suitable case study to answer the 
proposed research question: How does the 
implementation of blockchain technology 
shape the humanitarian sector? 
 
The analysis of the ‘Building Blocks’ 
highlights that humanitarian blockchain 
fosters 
collaboration 
and 
data-sharing 
between 
humanitarian 
organisations. 
In 
addition, blockchain technology impacts the 
humanitarian management approach with 
regard to governance and control. Power 
structures may only be re-centralised, and new 
actors might enter the picture. At this point, 
the 
extent, 
direction 
and 
speed 
of 
transformation are still unforeseen, but the 
change is underway. 
 
Reviewing the different perspectives of 
blockchain technology as explored in the 
literature background, it becomes clear that 
humanitarian blockchain must not only be 
evaluated simply as a technical tool. 
Blockchain technology needs to be analysed 
from a socio-technical perspective, taking 
contextual factors into account to adequately 
anticipate risks. Most notably, blockchain 
technology can be seen as an institutional 
technology that is fundamentally reshaping 
the humanitarian sector. 
 
6. Conclusion and Further Remarks 
Blockchain is a relatively new technology 
emerging with great speed. Especially 
16

L.Perlitt / iSCHANNEL 17(1): 12-19 
 
 
iS 
blockchain in the humanitarian sector is at an 
early stage, and its effectiveness and 
applicability are yet to be explored. ‘Building 
Blocks’ is one of the first and biggest 
blockchain-based 
solutions 
in 
the 
humanitarian sector deployed in multiple use 
cases. In this paper, I argue that while 
humanitarian blockchain has many benefits, 
several aspects demonstrate the potential to 
shape 
the 
humanitarian 
sector 
more 
fundamentally, in particular in terms of 
governance systems and power dynamics. 
Therefore, this paper does not only provide an 
overview of the benefits and risks involved 
with humanitarian blockchain, but also 
underlines the fundamental transformation of 
the humanitarian sector.  
 
Due to the scope of this paper, only one case 
study is explored, limiting the insights' 
transferability. Yet, the findings of this paper 
could be in particular valuable for similar 
blockchain-based solutions. For example, the 
Finnish Immigration Service has collaborated 
with a blockchain startup called MONI to 
improve financial access for refugees (Mike 
Orcutt, 2017). The analysis provides a basis 
for practitioners and researchers to explore 
further humanitarian blockchain and its 
application from a more holistic perspective. 
 
Further remarks that require more profound 
analysis are data privacy concerns. An 
interesting question that should be further 
explored is whether the right to be forgotten, 
as stated in the GDPR, also applies to 
humanitarian blockchain. In addition, the role 
of marginalised groups in the implementation 
of blockchain-based solutions should be 
addressed. Scholars criticise that marginalised 
groups of people serve as laboratories to test 
out 
unexplored 
technology 
(Madianou, 
2019b). Mainly because those people often 
live 
in 
dependence 
on 
humanitarian 
organisations. What would happen, for 
example, in a case of a data breach? Would the 
technology also be tested on a group of 
European citizens?  
 
Lastly, it is unclear how ‘Building Blocks’ fits 
into existing regulatory practices. Further 
implementation of blockchain in volatile 
humanitarian contexts is limited due to a lack 
and 
fragmentation 
of 
legislation 
and 
regulatory frameworks (Ko & Verity, 2016; 
Thylin & Duarte, 2019; Zwitter & Boisse-
Despiaux, 2018). Guidelines of who is legally 
responsible for the data or how regulators will 
ensure that the network and personal data are 
secure must be established collaboratively 
(Ko & Verity, 2016).
