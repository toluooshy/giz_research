Title of thesis: Between efficiency and do no harm: Blockchain-based innovation in 
cash and voucher assistance 
Abstract:  
 
The focus of this study is the determination of the risk factors for beneficiaries that arise 
from the use of blockchain technology in the delivery of cash and voucher assistance 
(CVA), as part of a framework for the identification of digital harm. The study also aims 
to use the said framework to create actionable points for humanitarian organizations 
working on reducing risks to beneficiaries when implementing this type of program. 
As the need for humanitarian assistance grows, trends such as cash and voucher 
assistance and digitalization emergence. CVA can lead to benefits such as cost efficiency, 
more timely and accurate meeting of beneficiaries’ needs, operational flexibility, and 
empowerment of beneficiaries. When blockchain is used in CVA, further benefits such 
as 
higher 
transparency 
and 
accountability, 
less 
corruption, 
security, 
and 
programmability can be acquired. Nevertheless, the analysis of the risks that arise from 
this implementation must be conducted, addressing a gap in both literature and 
practice.  
Through an extensive literature review and the investigation and comparison of three 
cases (the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks, Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash, and 
Finn Church Aid’s Kenya Feasibility Study), using an abductive research approach, this 
thesis has identified twelve risk factors, classified into five major categories, that make 
up the notion of digital risk to beneficiaries in blockchain-based CVA. This framework 
constitutes the study’s theoretical contribution. 
Furthermore, a list of seven measures was suggested to help humanitarian organizations 
in reducing digital harm to beneficiaries in the context in question. Those measures are 
considered the thesis’s managerial contribution.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Context and research problem 
In 2021, an estimated 235 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance and 
protection (Global Humanitarian Overview, 2022) – a number that is expected to reach 
339 million people in 2023 (The Guardian, 2022). As demand for humanitarian aid 
increases, so does the need for the humanitarian sector to be able to respond better. In 
this context, especially as events that lead to supply chain disruptions become more 
common, trends such as digitalization and cash and voucher assistance (CVA) emerge in 
humanitarian logistics (Kovács & Falagara Sigala, 2021).  
With the former, “combinations of information, computing, communication, and 
connectivity technologies” (Vial, 2019, p. 121) are used to promote substantial changes 
and improve organizations. With the latter, the traditional distribution of aid in the form 
of physical goods is replaced by the direct provision of money to beneficiaries, be it in the 
form of cash or vouchers (Heaslip, Kovács & Haavisto, 2018). These trends, furthermore, 
can be combined, enabling, for example, the use of digital payments – here defined as 
end-to-end digital transactions, or those in which both the medium of transfer used by 
payers and payees and the payment instrument are electronic (Burton, 2020).  
These digital transactions have the potential to increase the speed of delivery and the 
number of beneficiaries that can be reached by CVA programs, at a lower cost (Burton, 
2020). Beyond gains in efficiency and speed, which lead to cost savings, they can 
promote enhanced traceability and accountability, which, in their turn, increase 
transparency and security and reduce corruption and theft, and promote financial 
inclusion through access to financial services, among other benefits (Better than Cash 
Alliance, n.d.). They can also be safer for beneficiaries and humanitarian staff, as the 
risks of theft and looting that arise from carrying cash could be reduced (Burton, 2020). 
These benefits can contribute to mainstreaming a techno-optimistic narrative (Lee, 
2020), which emphasizes the increased levels of efficiency that digital technologies such 
as blockchain, which will be the focal point of this study, can bring to the humanitarian 
sector.   
Nevertheless, adopting innovative approaches in humanitarian operations, especially 
uncritically, can expose beneficiaries to new risks (Sandvik, Jacobsen & McDonald, 
2017). Considering that the very reason for the existence of humanitarian supply chains 

--- Page 8 ---
2 
is the meeting of beneficiaries’ needs (Thomas & Mizushima, 2005), these risks need to 
be further investigated, and strategies for their mitigation should be created. In doing so, 
the guiding principle of humanitarian action, do no harm, is updated to include the 
notion of do no digital harm (Burton, 2020).  
1.2 
Aim of the thesis 
Risk factors do not exist in abstraction; they are deeply contextual and must be 
determined in a case-by-case analysis (Burton, 2020). Because of this, the primary aim 
of this research is to determine the risk factors for beneficiaries that arise from the use 
of blockchain technology for the delivery of cash and voucher assistance. The secondary 
aim is to create a theoretical framework that can be used by humanitarian organizations 
when deciding whether the potential benefits of that implementation are proportional to 
the emerging risks posed to beneficiaries. 
The following research questions (RQ) are posed to achieve these aims: 
RQ 1: What are the main digital risks posed to beneficiaries when blockchain is 
used for the delivery of cash and voucher assistance? 
RQ 2: How can humanitarian organizations mitigate digital harm to 
beneficiaries when using blockchain technology for the delivery of cash and 
voucher assistance programs? 
1.3 
Methods 
Not only is the topic of the compatibility between the use of blockchain and humanitarian 
principles still underexplored in the literature, but most pilots that make use of that 
technology in the humanitarian sector do not have much information published about 
their implementations or results achieved (Coppi & Fast, 2019). Two cases stand out as 
exceptions: the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks, and Oxfam’s UnBlocked 
Cash. As that first program is so far the largest of its kind, it has attracted non-negligible 
media attention and has been covered in technology-focused publications. The second, 
while not often mentioned in the media, has published official reports after the project’s 
conclusion.  
Both of these implementations will be investigated in this study, in which a multiple-case 
analysis will be undertaken. The third case is that of Finn Church Aid’s 2019 Kenya 
Feasibility Study. Beyond two short articles on the websites of the organizations 

--- Page 9 ---

responsible for the program (Finn Church Aid and Solita Oy), there was no publicly 
available information before this thesis – thus making the exploration and reporting of 
that case particularly valuable for academic research. 
In this study, abductive research methods are used. Secondary data sources from the 
World Food Programme and Oxfam cases (Cases A and B, respectively), are considered 
during the first phase of the research alongside the relevant literature. From that, a 
theoretical framework of digital harm to beneficiaries is developed. That framework is 
then applied to Finn Church Aid’s case (Case C), using primary and secondary data 
sources, and fine-tuned so that concrete suggestions can be created to help humanitarian 
organizations in mitigating the risks identified.  
1.4 
Delimitations 
The three cases investigated in this study refer to projects developed by humanitarian 
organizations in which blockchain technology is used for delivering cash and voucher 
assistance. Case A – the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks – was launched in 
2017 in Pakistan and is currently active in Bangladesh and Jordan, serving, respectively, 
Rohingya and Syrian refugees (WFP, 2021). The sources used in this study are focused 
on the implementation in the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, particularly Azraq and 
Za’atari. Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash (Case B), was a pilot implemented in Vanuatu in 2019, 
in which 187 households were selected as beneficiaries (Rust, 2019). Finally, the 
Feasibility Study of Case C was conducted in November and December of 2019, and 
included fieldwork in Lokichar, Kakuma, and Kalobeyei, in Kenya, with a focus on 
refugee and internally displaced people. 
In the present research, the focus is on the beneficiaries’ perspective, as they are 
considered relevant actors in the humanitarian supply chain. This leads to two important 
delimitations. The first is that risk is not the same as an adoption barrier. Although issues 
such as the complexity of establishment and environmental sustainability (Coppi, 2020), 
or lack of technical standardization affect the implementation of blockchain solutions 
(Sahebi, Masoomi & Ghorbani, 2020), they are not a source of direct risk to beneficiaries 
and therefore, do not belong in the scope of this thesis. The second is that the use of 
blockchain technology in CVA programs can also pose risks to humanitarian 
organizations – notably causing a loss of legitimacy when projects implemented fail or, 
worse, harm to those they should be serving (Sandvik et al., 2017). Nevertheless, as 

--- Page 10 ---

stated before, since the central perspective of this research is that of beneficiaries, risks 
to organizations will not be discussed either. 
1.5 
Thesis outline 
In this Chapter 1, a brief overview of the context of the present study is given, and its 
aims and research questions are stated. The methods used to achieve those aims and 
provide answers to the research questions are presented, as well as the delimitations of 
the cases under analysis. Chapter 2 follows with a descriptive and thematic literature 
review, divided into three parts: cash and voucher assistance, digital harm, and 
blockchain technology’s use in CVA programs. In Chapter 3, the methodological aspect 
of the thesis is explored, including the research approach, the framework for the case 
study design, and its execution. In Chapter 4, the results of the empirical study are 
presented, and in Chapter 5, these findings are analyzed and compared to existing 
literature; based on them, guidelines are suggested for humanitarian organizations 
seeking to reduce the digital harms to beneficiaries that arise from the implementation 
of blockchain-based solutions in CVA programs. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes with a 
summary of the study and its theoretical and managerial contributions. An overall 
evaluation of the study is made, with future research recommendations being provided.

2 DIGITALIZING CASH AND VOUCHER ASSISTANCE WITH 
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 
In this Chapter, a descriptive and thematic literature review is presented, with a focus on 
three main points: cash and voucher assistance, digital harm, and the use of blockchain 
in CVA programs. That technology is considered an example of digitalization in the 
humanitarian supply chain (Baharmand, Saeed, Comes & Lauras, 2021b). Figure 1 shows 
how blockchain-based CVA, the focus area of this thesis, is situated at the intersection of 
two emerging fields in HSC. 
 
Figure 1 
Thesis focus area 
The literature on cash and voucher assistance covers the aspects of the definition of CVA, 
its modalities, factors that influence its implementation, the benefits observed, and the 
overall impact caused on humanitarian supply chains. The concept of digital harm is then 
introduced as a basis for the analysis of the use of blockchain for the delivery of cash and 
voucher assistance programs. After that, a short description of the technical aspects of 
blockchain is provided, with the way the technology can be used in cash and voucher 
assistance programs being explained. The potential benefits and digital risks brought by 
blockchain are summarized based on the ledger’s key characteristics of immutability, 
distribution, and decentralization. With that background established, tentative answers 
to the two research questions posed in this thesis can start to be formed, being structured 
in a framework of do no digital harm, thus addressing a critical gap in both literature 
and practice.  
2.1 
Cash and voucher assistance 
Humanitarian supply chains (HSCs) are defined as  

--- Page 12 ---

The process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow and 
storage of goods and materials, as well as related information, from point of origin to point of 
consumption for the purpose of meeting the end beneficiary’s requirements. (Thomas & 
Mizushima, 2005, p. 60) 
While this definition emphasizes the distribution of physical goods, in-kind assistance is 
by no means the only option available in humanitarian assistance. Another option, which 
has become increasingly popular since 2016 (Maghsoudi, Harpring, Piotrowicz & 
Heaslip, 2021), is providing beneficiaries with cash and vouchers. In this case, a voucher 
is defined as “a paper, token or electronic card that can be exchanged for a set quantity 
or value of goods, denomination either as a cash value or as predetermined commodities 
or services” (Heaslip, Haavisto & Kovács, 2015, p. 62). 
A widely accepted definition of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) is that brought by 
the Cash Learning Partnership. According to it, CVA ‘‘refers to all programs where cash 
transfers or vouchers for goods or services are directly provided to recipients” (CALP 
Network, n.d.). In the literature, this type of programming has also been referred to as 
Cash Based Assistance (CBA), Cash Transfer Programming (CTP), and Cash Based 
Intervention (CBI) (Maghsoudi et al., 2021). In this thesis, following the CALP definition, 
only the term Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) will be used. 
Although not a new phenomenon – as cash has been part of HO’s toolkit at least since 
1998, with IFRC’s response to Hurricane Mitch in Central America (Kovács, Matopoulos 
& Hayes, 2010) – the use of CVA has become more prevalent since 2016, with the Grand 
Bargain recommending the increased use and coordination of cash-based programming 
(Heaslip et al., 2018). The Covid-19 pandemic has also contributed to an increase in the 
use of CVA in both humanitarian and government social assistance (Lawson‐McDowall, 
McCormack & Tholstrup, 2021). Figure 2 shows the increase in global funding for CVA 
since 2016, which went from U$ 2.8 billion in that year to U$ 6.7 billion in 2021. The 
numbers represent total programming costs, not the transfer value, and do not include 
government-led social protection systems. While the numbers for 2022 are not yet 
available, they are predicted to continue growing due to the large multi-purpose cash 
response in Ukraine (Rieger, 2022).

(adapted from Rieger, 2022) 
According to Heaslip et al. (2018), cash transfers can be either unconditional or 
conditional. In the first case, beneficiaries can use the assistance as they wish; in the 
latter, specific requirements are set by the humanitarian organization, such as resources 
having to be directed to a certain finality. CVA includes a wide range of delivery 
mechanisms, such as debit and smart cards, mobile money transfers, and direct cash, 
with each mechanism bringing its own specific requirements and challenges (Maghsoudi 
et al., 2021).  
As explained by Maghsoudi et al. (2021), the choice to deliver assistance in one or more 
of these ways depends on a myriad of factors, which can be external or internal to the 
actors of a given HSC. External factors include the type of disaster (i.e. whether it is 
sudden or slow-onset, and natural or man-made, following Van Wassenhove’s 2006 
classification) and its phase, as well as aspects related to the local infrastructure (such as 
whether the banking system is operational), and political and economic situation. Within 
the political aspect are issues such as political support, and the economic aspect involves 
matters such as local inflation and unemployment rates. Internal factors, in their turn, 
can be divided into supply-side and demand-side (Maghsoudi et al., 2021). Supply-side 
factors include aspects such as whether local markets are functional and accessible to 
beneficiaries (Heaslip et al., 2018), while demand-side factors bring considerations such 
as beneficiary preferences, and the level of familiarity and access recipients may have 
with different payment instruments (Burton, 2020).

The analysis of such factors, as well as the definition of the delivery mechanisms or 
modalities, is part of the CVA Project Cycle. In its basic form, that cycle is made up of 
three main phases: preparedness, analysis and program design, and implementation 
(Shrestha & Smart, 2022). Each of them can be further divided into subcategories, as 
shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3 
CVA Project Cycle (adapted from Shrestha & Smart, 2022) 
During the preparedness phase, the focus lies on ensuring that both the responsible 
organization and its partners have the internal capabilities for implementing a CVA 
program, including human and financial resources. The evaluation of the general level 
of programmatic preparedness is also done in that first phase through pre-disaster 
assessments. In the analysis and program design phase, the question of whether CVA 
would be an appropriate response for a specific given context is explored. Four critical 
aspects are mapped during that step: needs and capacities of the local population, the 
local market’s functionality and accessibility, potential service providers to partner with, 
and the potential contextual, programmatic, and institutional risks that must be 
addressed. (Shrestha & Smart, 2022) 
This study is centered in an activity that takes place in the third phase of CVA Project 
Cycle, namely, the actual delivery of cash and voucher assistance to beneficiaries. Other 
activities in the implementation phase include contracting service providers, registering 
eligible CVA beneficiaries, monitoring outputs and results, and evaluating how program

is faring regarding relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability. 
(Shrestha & Smart, 2022) 
2.1.1 Benefits of cash and voucher assistance 
For humanitarian organizations, one of the most compelling reasons for the use of cash 
and voucher assistance is cost efficiency, especially given the reduced need for traditional 
logistical activities, such as transportation or warehousing (Heaslip et al., 2018). These 
activities account for a high proportion of the cost of a program, with the 2006 assertion 
that “disaster relief is about 80% logistics” (Van Wassenhove, 2006, p. 475) being often 
cited (Maghsoudi et al., 2021). 
Heaslip et al. (2018) emphasize that another critical benefit of CVA is that it can lead to 
recipients having their needs met more quickly and accurately. That becomes possible 
since beneficiaries can choose from the start what goods and services to purchase, 
enabling a pull strategy in the HSC. That strategy contrasts with the more traditional 
push strategy, in which a humanitarian organization “pushes” items until it has enough 
information to determine what is needed in a particular situation.  
Cash and voucher assistance programs can provide greater operational flexibility for 
humanitarian organizations, as well as enable increased speed in the distribution of aid 
and in the number of people that can receive it – especially when digital technologies are 
used (Burton, 2020). CVA can also bring benefits to the communities where the 
programs are implemented, as the increased demand for goods and services can 
stimulate the local economy (Heaslip et al., 2015), which contributes to improving the 
coexistence with host communities (Burton, 2020). 
Finally, allowing beneficiaries to make their own choices can be empowering and 
dignifying (Heaslip et al., 2015). The increased participation of beneficiaries brought by 
CVA (Maghsoudi et al., 2021), furthermore, can lead to changes in the power dynamics 
between them, humanitarian agencies, and other stakeholders within the humanitarian 
sector, such as governments and donors (Burton, 2020). These changes support a new 
view of aid recipients, who go from a passive role in the HSC to an active one (Kovács et 
al., 2010), and contribute to a more socially sustainable system (Kovács & Spens, 2011).   
2.1.2 Changes in the Humanitarian Supply Chain 
A final point regarding CVA programs is that they lead to the participation of new actors, 
such as financial institutions and mobile phone companies, creating diagonal or cross-

--- Page 16 ---
10 
sector partnerships, as explained by Heaslip et al. (2018). As a result, the very structure 
of humanitarian supply chains is modified. A way to visualize this change is through the 
different flows that make up the HSC: material (regarding physical goods), 
informational, and financial (Van Wassenhove, 2006). In Figure 4, the basic structure of 
a traditional HSC is represented. In it, humanitarian organizations use the financial 
resources received from donors to purchase the goods that will be distributed to 
beneficiaries. The figure’s orange arrows represent material flows, while the green 
arrows symbolize the financial ones.  
 
 
Figure 4 
Traditional humanitarian supply chain (adapted from Heaslip et al., 2015) 
In Figure 5, the structural change brought by the implementation of a CVA program is 
shown. Humanitarian organizations no longer acquire goods from suppliers; instead, the 
cash and voucher assistance provided to beneficiaries allows them to directly purchase 
the goods and services they require. The orange and green arrows have the same meaning 
as those in Figure 3.

The models above are simplified and do not include all the actors in the humanitarian 
supply chain. As explained by Heaslip et al. (2018), the distribution of goods from 
humanitarian organizations to beneficiaries shown in Figure 3, for example, is usually 
done by third-party logistics service providers, local NGOs, and local authorities. 
Financial flows, in both Figures 3 and 4, are normally intermediated by financial 
institutions such as banks and payment service providers.  
Crucially, technological innovations can lead to further changes in the cash and voucher 
assistance supply chain. The way this happens will be explained in the following sections, 
and its impacts on beneficiaries will be investigated. Before that, however, the notion of 
digital harm must be presented. 
2.2 Digital harm  
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(2022), humanitarian action should be guided by the principles of humanity, neutrality, 
impartiality, and independence, which are based in the Fundamental Principles of the 
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of 1965. Under the principle of 
humanity, the purpose of humanitarian action is to address human suffering wherever it 
is found, protecting the life and health of human beings. Neutrality prescribes that 
humanitarian actors should not take sides, while impartiality means that need ought to 
be the basis for providing assistance – any other factor, such as the beneficiaries’ beliefs, 
nationality, or race, should not be taken into account. Finally, independence states that 
humanitarian action should be autonomous, independent from any political, economic, 
or military objectives. These principles, when combined, lead to the duty to do no harm. 
By that imperative,  
those involved in humanitarian responses must take steps to avoid or minimize any adverse effects 
of their intervention, in particular the risk of exposing people to increased danger or abuse of their 
rights. (Sandvik et al., 2017, p. 323).  
Because of this, a critical evaluation of the risks that can potentially arise from an 
intervention must be conducted. As argued by Sandvik et al. (2017), this evaluation is 
especially needed when new technologies are used in the humanitarian context, 
involving vulnerable populations and unstable environments, in which risks are 
exacerbated. In these situations, the supposed exceptionality of emergency can be 
exploited to legitimate the use of untested innovations. Once the logic that “something 
must be done” is deployed, even non-consented interventions can be deemed justifiable, 

--- Page 18 ---
12 
with as protection and safety considerations are “weighed against assumptions of 
immediate health benefits or knowledge to be gained” (Sandvik et al., 2017, p. 328).  
The consideration of the digital dimension of do no harm includes aspects such as data 
management and the overall way humanitarian organizations and their partners interact 
with beneficiaries in “the digital space” (Burton, 2020, p. 48). This dimension is related 
to the concept of data responsibility, which can be defined as 
a set of principles, processes and tools that support the safe, ethical and effective management of 
data in humanitarian response. This includes data privacy, protection, and security, as well as 
other practical measures to mitigate risk and prevent harm. (Burton, 2020, p. 57) 
While there is no definition for digital harm, risk factors can be listed, and frameworks 
can be created to highlight these risks relate to the potential benefits that a given 
implementation can bring. The primary aim of this study, therefore, as stated in Chapter 
1, is to identify what these risks would be when blockchain is used for the delivery of cash 
and voucher assistance.  
Every technology brings with it benefits and risks, and blockchain is no exception (Lee, 
2020). As noted by Sandvik et al. (2014), techno-optimistic narratives, which are based 
on the belief in the power of technology to promote positive change, tend to be 
widespread. In the case of the use of blockchain in CVA programs, that optimism can be 
seen especially in the emphasis on efficiency gains that is given by both media and 
practitioners (Lee, 2020). While that narrative might not be as explicit in academic 
publications, in which a degree of techno-skepticism can be observed (Lee, 2020), there 
is still a significant gap that needs to be addressed. A considerable part of the literature 
tries to transpose the benefits and challenges found in blockchain implementations from 
the commercial sector to humanitarian supply chains (Baharmand, Maghsoudi & Coppi,, 
2021a), failing to examine the aspects in which these sectors differ, notably with regard 
to humanitarian principles.  These principles might be violated by the uncritical 
implementation of new tools in the humanitarian sector (Sandvik et al., 2014), exposing 
vulnerable communities to risk (Baharmand et al., 2021b).  
The principle of humanity, for example, might be violated if people are put at risk or their 
access to aid becomes compromised because of the misuse of their data. Furthermore, as 
technologies are never neutral, they may be used in ways to escalate conflicts, violating 
the principle of neutrality. Finally, if factors such as access to mobile phones or literacy 
become requirements for accessing aid, the impartiality that should guide humanitarian 
aid is lost, as people in need might not be reached. (Sandvik et al., 2014).

2.3 Blockchain technology for cash and voucher assistance 
The first application of blockchain – even though the word blockchain itself is not 
mentioned in that text – dates back to Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 whitepaper. That 
system, which formed the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network, was designed to replace 
central trust with cryptographic proof to solve the double-spending problem. In it, 
parties can make peer-to-peer transactions, meaning that no intermediaries or trusted 
third parties are need. (Nakamoto, 2008).  
Third parties can be bypassed in the system because transactions are compiled in blocks 
and broadcasted to the entire network. Each new block is added to the network in a 
linear, sequential order, being cryptographically linked to the previous block – creating 
then a chain of blocks. Furthermore, each additional block has to be validated by every 
computer that runs that blockchain. That makes changing past transactions impossible, 
ensuring that the ledger is immutable and tamper-proof, and as data is visible to all 
participant nodes, the system is completely transparent. (Coppi & Fast, 2019). 
Blockchain can be defined as a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (Baharmand et al., 
2021b): it is a consensus-based, distributed, immutable and append-only electronic 
ledger, in which information is automatically updated and made visible to all participants 
of the network (Rodríguez-Espíndola, Chowdhury, Beltagui & Albores, 2020). It 
promises “a more transparent, accountable, efficient and secure way of exchanging 
decentralized stores of information that are independently updated, automatically 
replicated and immutable” (Coppi & Fast, 2019, viii), with the power to “reshape 
information, communication and financing at the deepest level” (Coppi, 2018).  
Blockchains can be public or private. In the first case, as explained by Coppi and Fast 
(2019), they are open to all users to view transactions; in the latter, only an approved set 
of users can do so. Another way to classify them is into permissionless and permissioned, 
depending on whether users need previous authorization to add transactions to the 
network. A blockchain can also be run by a consortium of organizations and agencies, 
which can have different roles as nodes; as an example, all nodes could have permission 
to view transactions, but only a restricted number could be able to validate new 
transactions in the system (Hunt, Narayanan & Zhuan, 2022). Humanitarian 
organizations tend to prefer private and permissioned blockchains (Seyedsayamdost & 
Vanderwal, 2020; Madianou, 2019). 

--- Page 20 ---
14 
The current research on blockchain is situated in the context of both its growing adoption 
on the field (Madianou, 2019) and scholarly interest in the role of digital technologies in 
humanitarian supply chains (Marić, Galera-Zarco & Opazo-Basáez, 2021). A number of 
potential use cases has been highlighted in the literature: tracking donor financing 
(ICRC, 2020), distribution and tracking of aid (Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018) and 
relief items (Baharmand et al., 2021a); ID management (Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 
2018); facilitation of collaboration between actors during disaster relief (Dubey et al., 
2020), including between emergency responders and business organizations in order to 
directly share resources (L'Hermitte & Nair, 2021). They can involve both back-end 
processes and end-user experiences, although the former seems to be more relevant for 
humanitarian supply chains (Coppi & Fast, 2019). Blockchain can allow, furthermore, 
the automation of logistical processes with smart contracts, leading to cost reduction 
(Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). Conditions could be programmed, for example, into 
“qualified money”, such as what types of goods or services it can be used to buy, or by 
who (Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018), or to initiatives that are empowering to women 
and girls (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). 
In this work, the focus will be in the use of the technology in cash and voucher assistance, 
with three key characteristics of blockchain being explored: immutability, distribution, 
and decentralization. Emphasis is given to how each of them can lead to benefits in the 
supply chain of cash and voucher assistance, as well as which potential risks they can 
pose to beneficiaries. 
2.3.1 Immutability 
In a blockchain, all transactions are recorded and they cannot be deleted or modified; 
information can only ever be added to the system (Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020). As 
data cannot be altered or removed after it has been registered, the information recorded 
becomes tamper-proof. This immutability is considered one of the most distinctive and 
transformative features of blockchain (Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020), assuming 
that the data registered in the system is correct in the first place – in what is known as 
the “garbage in, garbage out” problem (Thylin & Duarte, 2019).  
In humanitarian supply chains, lack of transparency is regarded as a major issue 
(Baharmand et al., 2021a). A sequential, tamper-proof, and append-only record could 
provide not only a trail for relief items, but for other transactions, such as financial flows, 
improving traceability in the HSC. Such transparency, and subsequent accountability, 

--- Page 21 ---
15 
could reduce the possibility of corruption or misallocation of funds (Zwitter & Boisse-
Despiaux, 2018). It is important to note, however, that private blockchains do not 
guarantee the same immutability as public ones. As such, blockchains controlled by a 
reduced number of entities might not be able to ensure greater traceability, given that 
these entities would be able to modify transactions if they so choose.  
The same immutability that can be used to hold actors accountable, however, means that 
inaccurate or incorrect data cannot be rectified and will remain in the system (Zwitter & 
Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). This could lead to grave consequences for displaced people 
(Madianou, 2019). Immutability also raises legal questions, as the implications of 
blockchain for data protection are not yet fully known. As an example, under the 
European General Data Protection Regulation, subjects have the right to have their 
personal data rectified and erased, which stands in clear contradiction with an 
immutable system (ICRC, 2020). It must be noted that it is not given that the GDPR will 
be applicable to a given program, but that the uncertainty generated by the absence of a 
clear regulatory framework can be regarded as a source of risk in itself (Coppi & Fast, 
2019). 
Workarounds, such as off-chain solutions with logical deletion, exist. In that case, the 
organization does not register personal information on the blockchain, especially if they 
are public (ICRC, 2020); rather, off-chain databases designed in ways that are compliant 
with the relevant data protection regulation can be cryptographically linked to the 
blockchain (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). If the data subject then requests the deletion of his 
or her personal data, it can be removed from the off-chain database alongside the 
decryption key associated with it. The information will still be on the blockchain, but 
without the key, it will remain encrypted and impossible to access (ICRC, 2020). This 
approach for not storing personal data on the blockchain is often the one chosen by 
humanitarian organizations (Coppi & Fast, 2019). 
Such workarounds are not, however, entirely satisfactory, especially considering the 
present limitations of data protection in humanitarian operations (ICRC, 2020). The use 
of consent as a basis for data collection and processing in those settings, for example, can 
be considered problematic given the power asymmetry between organizations and 
beneficiaries (Thylin & Duarte, 2019), and how the latter might not understand what that 
consent would entail (Lee, 2020). Finally, opting out cannot be said to be a real option 
when the refusal to consent leads to a vulnerable person not receiving the aid he or she 
needs (Madianou, 2019; Burton, 2020). 

--- Page 22 ---
16 
A final point to note is that it can also be argued that the immutability of blockchain can 
pose a risk to beneficiaries not only from a data protection perspective, but also 
considering their dignity. As Howson notes, beneficiaries are required to give up 
sensitive personal information, such as biometrics, to an immutable archive, in order to 
access basic and temporary benefits (Howson, 2020). Although proportionally and 
fairness may seem like abstract notions, it is important to emphasize that the goals of 
humanitarian assistance go beyond saving lives and alleviating suffering, as it is also 
intended to maintain human dignity (Urquhart, Girling, Nelson-Pollard & Mason, 2022).  
2.3.2 Distribution 
As explained by Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2020), in a blockchain, all participants of 
the network have an identical copy of the entire ledger. Whenever a new transaction is 
added to the system, the copies are automatically updated in all nodes, ensuring that 
participants always have access to the data in full. Because of that, blockchain is deemed 
as a highly transparent system, allowing for each transaction to be monitored.  
In humanitarian supply chains, information-sharing and visibility is often limited 
(Baharmand et al., 2021a), with the shortage of critical information being a frequent 
challenge for humanitarian operations when attempting to allocate resources efficiently 
(Baharmand et al., 2021b). As blockchain enables network participants to see new 
transactions in real-time (Thylin & Duarte, 2019), it can help to build swift trust and 
enable cooperation (Dubey et al., 2020). The improved information sharing between 
participating organizations, by their turn, could result in better decision-making 
(Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020) and more resilient humanitarian supply chains 
(Dubey et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, as copies of the entire database are stored in the computers participating 
in the network, even if one or more of these participants become compromised, the 
system will still continue to run without changes to the data stored (Coppi & Fast, 2019). 
Because of this, blockchain is considered to have a high degree of security, meeting all 
three key principles of data securiy (i.e. confidentiality, integrity, and availability) (ICRC, 
2020). That security could contribute to an overall reduction of cyber risks (Zwitter & 
Boisse-Despiaux, 2018), a relevant point since humanitarian organizations are 
increasingly becoming targets of digital attacks (Burton, 2020).  
It is important to note, however, that the increased transparency brought by that system 
tends to be limited to organizations and does not reach individuals – who may not be 

--- Page 23 ---
17 
aware that a blockchain-based system is being used (Coppi & Fast, 2019). That is 
particularly relevant when private platforms are used – which is often the case in 
humanitarian implementations. If the ways in which the system works are not made 
public, accountability beyond that to donors might not exist, with the technology being 
a “black box” (Lee, 2020).  
Furthermore, humanitarian organizations tend to collect too much data (Sandvik et al., 
2014), and in a transparent system, that data is shared with actors such as host 
governments and commercial partners. Beneficiaries are often not informed about other 
parties that could have access to their data, and how they would use it (Madianou, 2019), 
raising issues about consent. Not only that, but once data is shared, humanitarian 
organizations have no way to control how it will be used (Burton, 2020), especially if 
clear policies and legal frameworks are not in place (Madianou, 2019).  
That data might be used for purposes unrelated to the provision of humanitarian 
assistance, which it was originally collected for. From a commercial perspective, the data 
could be used for profiling potential customers and targeting ads (Burton, 2020). Even 
more severely, especially when States are involved, humanitarian data can lead to harms 
such as involuntary repatriation of refugees and further persecution (Lee, 2020). That 
was the case with biometric data collected by the UNHCR from Rohingya refugees, which 
was shared with the government of Myanmar – the very State responsible for the 
persecution of that minority (Rahman, 2021). Finally, critical literature points out that 
the level of transparency and control afforded by blockchain could lead to a form of 
“surveillance philanthropy” (Howson, 2020, p. 3). In it, the interests and visions of 
donors would be prioritized over the needs of beneficiaries and organizations’ abilities 
to respond to changes in the environment they operate (Howson, 2020).  
Those misuses of humanitarian data are especially critical when highly sensitive personal 
information is used in the system. Although it might not be possible to say with certainty 
whether a particular piece of information will be sensitive in a given context (Sandvik et 
al., 2014), biometric data will likely always be considered as such due to its inherent 
connection with individuals. Biometrics can be defined as “a technology for measuring, 
analyzing, and processing a person’s physiological characteristics, such as fingerprints, 
iris, facial patterns, voice, hand geometry, and DNA” (Madianou, 2019, p. 583). It can be 
used for both identification – when a one-to-many comparison is made, with a record 
being compared to a larger database – and verification processes – when the 
authentication is one-to-one, with a record being checked against a specific entry in the 

--- Page 24 ---
18 
database. In the context of blockchain-based programs, biometrics tend to be used for 
such purposes (Madianou, 2019), despite the fact that the collection and use of biometric 
data can lead to risks “even in the absence of ill intentions or negligence” (Sandvik et al., 
2017, p. 340).  
Because of this, humanitarian organizations are advised to conduct a Data Protection 
Impact Assessment, which can help to map the privacy risks that arise from the 
deployment of a blockchain-based system and indicate avenues for mitigating them 
(ICRC, 2020). If there are less intrusive means, from a data protection perspective, that 
can achieve the goals of a program while presenting fewer risks to beneficiaries, those 
should be implemented instead. As Sandvik et al. (2014) note, however, privacy and 
efficiency exist in tension. Resources are needed in order to mitigate risks to 
beneficiaries: staff needs to be trained in data collection, security, and sharing, and 
investments in technology and infrastructure in the organization might be required.   In 
situations of emergency, nevertheless, these resources might not be available.  
2.3.3 Decentralization 
Decentralization, by its turn, is related to mechanisms of consensus and validation, 
which require that network participants agree on each new transaction added to the 
system (ICRC, 2020). As this process of validation is required, the chances of a single 
organization or malicious party adding data to the system are very low, especially in 
public blockchains with a high number of validating nodes (Coppi & Fast, 2019).  
As transactions are automatically verified by this consensus mechanism and 
participating nodes have real-time access to data, there is no need for a controlling 
central intermediary (Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020). Because of this, when 
implemented in CVA programs, blockchain can reduce the resources spent by 
intermediaries on administrative processes, with funds being directed to activities that 
can impact beneficiaries (Baharmand et al., 2021b). Bypassing traditional banking 
institutions, for example, could lead to savings in service fees, as well as reducing the 
time required for the distribution of aid (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). 
Nevertheless, two critical points must be considered regarding this potential 
disintermediation. As noted by Seyedsayamdost and Vanderwal, although the role of 
some third parties, such as financial institutions, can be reduced, the participation of 
others, especially those with technical expertise, becomes more prominent. As such, 
“decentralization and democratization of decision-making are not a given when using 

--- Page 25 ---
19 
blockchain technology” (2020, p. 956). Furthermore, as humanitarian organizations 
tend to outsource the technical aspect of a project development to these new actors 
(Baharmand et al, 2021b), they may not develop a sufficient internal understanding of 
the technology, which is considered highly complex (Lee, 2020). This knowledge gap can 
create the perception of risk within the organization (Coppi & Fast, 2019) and, as the 
humanitarian staff itself does not understand and trust the system they are working with, 
it becomes harder for them to create risk mitigation and protection strategies. 
The second critical point is that disintermediation tends to lead to a detrimental 
reduction in the role of downstream actors. As noted by Coppi (2020), when blockchain 
is used to transfer funds directly to beneficiaries, bypassing local financial institutions, 
those native businesses are not activated, taxes are not collected, and that community 
may become more dependent of foreign aid and institutions. This can, furthermore, lead 
to local governments and central backs reacting negatively to humanitarian 
organizations and donors (Martin et al., 2022).  
As mentioned in the previous section, the current disintermediation that was supposed 
to arise from the implementation of blockchain is more of a replacement of traditional 
actors with new, more technically-oriented ones. These new actors entering the HSC, 
such as technology companies and financial service providers, benefit from the 
legitimacy (Jutel, 2022) and operational license given by humanitarian organizations 
(Sandvik et al., 2017). Nevertheless, they are not bound by their principles of action, legal 
frameworks and mandates (McDonald, 2021), and can alter the power dynamics in the 
humanitarian supply in ways that may endanger beneficiaries (Coppi & Fast, 2019).  
That point is especially sensitive as new actors might have different motivations for 
wanting to participate in humanitarian operations. They may range from a legitimate 
attempt of corporate social responsibility to a mere commercial desire to reach new 
markets, and it is unclear how certain humanitarian organizations can ever be of a 
potential partner’s motivation. The vulnerability of beneficiaries, however, and the fact 
that they can become easy targets to companies and be led to accept terms that go against 
their own interests, makes public-private partnerships a source of risk  that needs to be 
considered. (Sandvik et al., 2014) 
2.4 Theoretical framework 
A theoretical framework is designed to explain the “key factors, constructs or variables” 
of a study and how they related to each other (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 18). After this 

--- Page 26 ---
20 
research has identified both the potential benefits and risks to beneficiaries that may 
arise from the use of blockchain for delivery in CVA programs, its theoretical framework 
can be presented. This framework is regarded as necessary due to its specificity to the 
humanitarian context. As Baharmand et al. (2021b) note, the adoption of an existing 
framework from the commercial sector could lead to violations of humanitarian 
principles, as it would not have been designed with those principles in mind in the first 
place. 
Lewin’s Force Field analysis is “a method of analyzing causal relations and of building 
scientific constructs” (Lewin, 1943, p. 294). In it, the forces that influence a situation, 
either driving or restraining it, are mapped and represented in opposition (Fisher, 2010). 
Although more widely used in the area of organization development (Thomas, 1985), it 
was chosen for this study due to its ability to convey the dynamic nature of the balancing 
act that is choosing whether or not to implement blockchain technology in the case under 
discussion. Furthermore, it shows that the factors are part of a larger system (Thomas, 
1985), which must be considered as a totality, not as mere components to be individually 
dealt with.   
In Figure 6, potential benefits are represented as enabling forces, while the possible risks 
are constraining forces. The relative strength of each enabling or constraining force is 
not shown, as it will depend on the specific context of a given CVA program.

3 RESEARCH METHODS 
In this chapter, aspects related to the methodology of the present study are discussed. It 
begins by explaining the philosophy underlining the research and why it is suitable for 
achieving the study’s stated aims. After that, the choices that inform the design of this 
research are presented, including the abductive approach and qualitative methods. The 
sampling strategies and data sources are then considered, with the process of data 
collection and analysis being explained for both primary and secondary sources. Finally, 
the techniques used for evaluating the quality of this study are specified.  
3.1 
Research philosophy 
In logistics studies, three main research paradigms can be identified: positivism, 
scientific realism, and interpretivism (Kovács & Spens, 2007). Attempts in building 
theory – defined as “any coherent description or explanation of observed or experienced 
phenomena” (Gioia & Pitre, 1990, p. 587) – require from a researcher the appropriate 
understanding of one’s chosen paradigm, as the assumptions it brings will influence that 
process of creation. The positivist approach, for instance, with its belief in objectivity and 
universality claims, has been criticized for not being conducive to the development of 
new theories; when combined with deductive methods, it can often lead only to the 
modification of existing frameworks (Gioia & Pitre, 1990). The interpretivism paradigm, 
in its turn – in which the relationship between researcher and phenomenon under 
investigation is emphasized and the existence of absolute truths is rejected – is better 
suited for the building of theories focused on descriptions and explanations, but not on 
predictions (Kovács & Spens, 2007).  
In this thesis, the underlying research paradigm chosen is that of scientific realism, 
which stands as a “middle ground” between the two above-mentioned approaches. 
Under that approach, according to Kovács and Spens (2007), it is believed that, despite 
the fact that there is an objective nature to the world, the ways to perceive, create 
knowledge about, and interpret it are context-dependent. Scientific realism, 
furthermore, is compatible with abductive research methods, which are used in this 
study, as will be explained in the following section. 
3.2 Research design 
In the abductive research process, empirical observations are the starting point, even if 
the researcher takes advantage of pre-existing theoretical knowledge – as that knowledge 
should be used to find the spot in which the reality observed does not match the previous 

--- Page 29 ---
23 
theories. As the goal in the abductive approach is the development of theory, the 
suggestion of new hypotheses and propositions is made in the second step of the research 
process. Those, in their turn, are applied to further empirical research in order to test the 
conclusions reached. (Kovács & Spens, 2005) 
Theory-building is one of the main purposes of this work, thus making the abductive 
approach suitable for the study. Furthermore, as the framework about the risks of using 
blockchain technology in the delivery of CVA programs is built, moving back and forth 
between the theoretical and empirical realms contributes to its accurate representation 
of the reality investigated.  
In this thesis, the first step of the process is the analysis of two cases (the World Food 
Programme’s Building Blocks and Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash; respectively, Cases A and 
B), which are compared to the techno-optimistic literature already known by the 
researcher. A new element is introduced to the analysis – the consideration of risks to 
beneficiaries – and a theoretical framework is suggested. After that, the framework is 
tested on the case study about Finn Church Aid (Case C). Finally, the conclusions drawn 
from the application of the framework to FCA’s case are compared to those reached in 
the analysis of the two previously mentioned projects, and concrete guidelines are 
suggested to humanitarian organizations. The process is shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7 
The study’s abductive research process (based on Kovács & Spens, 2005). 
This thesis also uses qualitative research methods, which allow for in-depth and detailed 
analysis (Patton, 2002), especially when case studies are used to “explain, explore or 
describe a topic of interest” (Vega, 2018, p. 180). Through that combination, insight can 
be gained into little-known phenomena (Vega, 2018). Patton identifies seven types of 
knowledge that can be generated through qualitative inquiry. Of those, two are 
particularly relevant to the aim of this thesis: the identification of unanticipated 
consequences and side effects, and the discovery of patterns across cases (Patton, 2002).

3.3 Sampling strategy 
As qualitative studies are often done with small sample sizes, sampling strategies must 
be selected purposefully in order to promote an in-depth understanding of the 
phenomenon under observation (Patton, 2002). Because of that, purposeful sampling 
will be used in this study, with a focus on the selection of information-rich cases. 
Nevertheless, still according to Patton (2002), before further sampling strategies can be 
selected, the units of analysis to be studied must be defined. As they are not mutually 
exclusive, being therefore possible for a study to contain multiple units of analysis, this 
thesis will focus on two units. In Table 1, these units are presented alongside the sampling 
strategies used for them.

other project participants, who will be invited 
to participate in the study. The process will be 
repeated until no more participants can be 
found.

3.4 Data collection  
Yin (2015) describes three conditions for the use of case studies: the main research 
questions have to do with how and why, no control of behavioral events is required, and 
the focus of the research lies on contemporary events. All three of these conditions are 

--- Page 31 ---
25 
fulfilled in the present research, especially as case studies can utilize multiple sources, 
including interviews and written documents, to triangulate data, enabling an even 
deeper understanding of the subject being investigated. 
A multiple case study is conducted in this thesis. Cases A and B – respectively, the World 
Food Programme’s current Building Blocks project, and the Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash 
pilot that took place in Vanuatu in 2019 – are considered, as explained above, in the first 
phase of the abductive research process. After a thereotical framework is developed, Case 
C, which refers to Finn Church Aid’s Feasibility Study conducted in Kenya in 2019, is 
investigated. The first two cases were chosen for two major reasons: they are deemed 
representative and have been widely documented. Publicly available information about 
Case C, by its turn, was scant; nevertheless, the author had personal knowledge of and 
access to the organization responsible for it.  
According to Yin (2015), multiple case studies can offer more compelling and robust 
evidence. It is expected that all three cases selected will show variation in their design 
choices and implementations, but that these variations and their consequences to 
beneficiaries can be justified in light of the theoretical framework developed in this study 
– thus following a logic of theoretical replication (Yin, 2015).   
Three main types of data can be used as sources for qualitative research: interviews, 
direct observations, and written communications (Patton, 2002). In this study, two of 
them will be used, with semi-structured interviews being the study’s primary data source, 
while the secondary sources are written documents.  
According to Roulston (2010), interviews, which can be of several types, such as 
journalistic, motivational, and diagnostic, have question-answer sequences as the basic 
units of interaction. These questions can be closed or open. In the first case, the answers 
generated are either negative or affirmative; in the second, participants have more 
freedom to elaborate answers using their own words – with the latter type of answers 
being generally preferred on qualitative research, as they allow for more information to 
be provided by respondents.  
As explained by Patton, with interviews, the researcher can “enter into the other person’s 
perspective” (2002, p. 341), thus enabling access to information that could not be 
obtained by mere observation, such as a person’s previous behavior, or his or her 
intentions, motivations, and feelings. Three main approaches can be used to collect 

--- Page 32 ---
26 
qualitative data through interviews: the informal conversation interview (also known as 
unstructured interviewing), the general interview guide, and the standardized open-
ended interview. The second approach was chosen for this study. With a semi-structured 
interview, conducted with the help of an interview guide, predetermined questions allow 
the interaction to remain focused on the key aspects, while, at the same time, providing 
enough flexibility to pursue interesting points that emerge from the conversation with 
the participants (Patton, 2002).  
The use of documents, by its turn, can serve multiple purposes in research, from bringing 
background and contextual information to observing how a program or organization has 
changed over time (Bowen, 2009). In this study, two purposes are emphasized. The first 
is identifying new questions or relevant points to be added to the study. As previously 
explained, this thesis has chosen to use the abductive research approach, so the analysis 
of the documents from Cases A and B is done parallel to the Literature Review. The 
second purpose is to allow for triangulation. By showing that findings are consistent 
across different types of sources, such as documents and interviews, and highlighint the 
patterns that arise from them, the study’s credibility can be enhanced (Patton, 2002).  
3.4.1 Primary data sources 
The primary data is refers to semi-structured interviews with people familiar with the 
above-mentioned Feasibility Study. Interviwees 2 and 3 have worked in it from the 
beginning, while Interviewees 1 and 4 became acquainted with it at a later stage. The 
questions were inspired by the literature review conducted in Chapter 2, especially by 
The Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action (Kuner & Marelli, 2020), as 
well as Oxfam’s Unlocking Digital Cash and Voucher Assistance: A Guide to Digital 
Options (Kayastha et al., 2022). The complete list of interview questions is found in 
Appendix 1.  
The interviews took place between November 2nd and 15th, involving four respondents. 
Three of these interviews (with Interviewees 1, 2 and 4), were conducted online, via 
Teams; the other was done in person (Interviewee 3). In Table 2, the Respondent Codes, 
as well as the organizations they represent, are listed. The interview dates and the 
duration of each are also informed.

3.4.2 Secondary data sources 
The secondary data, in its turn, encompasses written documents. These documents can 
be in several forms, including organizational reports and case studies – the main types 
used in this study. As a process, the use of written documents for research includes 
multiple steps, as the appropriate and relevant documents must be found, selected, and 
appraised, until the data contained in them can be synthesized (Bowen, 2009). In total, 
11 such documents were analyzed in this study. Of those, four were official reports 
created by the organizations implementing the programs; four others were non-
academic case studies by experts; and three were pages on the websites of the responsible 
organizations, in which their respective cases were presented. The documents are listed 
in Table 3.

Table 3 Secondary data sources 
It is important to note that the Feasibility Study in Case C is considered a confidential 
document. Because of that, it was agreed with Finn Church Aid that it could be used as a 
source to inform the research design and could be referenced during the interviews, but 
direct quotes or references would not be allowed. 
3.5 Data analysis 
Through the process of data analysis, the data collected can be transformed into findings 
(Patton, 2002). In the present work, as a multiple case study is conducted, this process 
of analysis is centered in trying to find recurring themes and patterns among cases A, B, 
and C.  
3.5.1 Interviews 
The primary data, which was collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key 
informants, was analyzed using Spiggle’s (1994) qualitative data manipulation 
operations. The first of these is categorization, by which units of data are classified. These 
units can be of any length, as long as they contain meaning. Before the interviews were 
conducted, four a priori categories were identified: background, program structure, 
benefits, and risks. As advised by Miles & Huberman (1994), these codes were derived 
from this study’s research questions and the theoretical framework proposed. As the 

--- Page 35 ---
29 
interviews were conducted, transcribed, and color-coded, new themes emerged. These 
emerging themes were background, context, regulation, design, transparency, 
accessibility, privacy, coordination, security, implementation, partners, speed, 
biometrics, beneficiary response, and power dynamics.  
The emerging themes were further analyzed in order to identify potential patterns in the 
data. In this operation, which Spiggle (1994) defines as abstraction, the categories 
previously identified are revised and grouped into classes of a higher conceptual level. In 
this study, the classes identified were program structure (which included the previous 
categories of background and context), benefits (including transparency, accessibility, 
privacy, coordination, security, and speed), implementation (with design, regulation, 
and partners as subcategories), and risks (which considered the subcategories of 
biometrics, beneficiary response, and power dynamics). At the same time that these 
classes were being structured, the operation of comparison was being undertaken, as 
analyzing the similarities and differences between the subcategories that were being 
classified helped to ensure that they were included in the correct class. 
The operations of integration and iteration, by which, respectively, the relationships 
between the classes are highlighted to facilitate theory-building, and data collection and 
analysis are considered in parallel (Spiggle, 1994), were used throughout the entire case 
study. Finally, refutation was done as part of the process of iteration, as the emerging 
findings were intentionally scrutinized during their development, to make them more 
consistent and robust. 
3.5.2 Documents 
Document analysis is a “systematic procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents — 
both printed and electronic” (Bowen, 2009, p. 27). It includes skimming, reading, and 
interpreting the materials selected in an iterative process (Bowen, 2009). In this thesis, 
the 11 documents selected were subjected to both content and thematic analysis. In the 
first phase of the abductive research process, content analysis was used in the documents 
referring to Cases A and B, with broad categories related to the research questions being 
identified. After the development of the theoretical framework depicted in Figure 5, the 
documents from those cases were re-read, and thematic analysis was performed. The 
factors listed in the theoretical framework were used as predefined codes for the 
documents for all cases, and the relevant arguments and quotes were selected based on 
them.

3.5.3 Ethical considerations 
The four people interviewed for this study were properly informed of its purpose and 
scope, and have agreed on their own accord to participate on it. Before the interview, 
they gave consent for the collection and processing of their personal data, being informed 
of how the data was going to be used, which types of data could be made public, and for 
how long data would be kept. Their consent was also given for the video and audio 
recording of the interviews.  
3.5.4 Quality of the study 
Finally, to ensure its quality, this study will be evaluated according to the five dimensions 
of trustworthiness developed by Wallendorf and Belk (1989): credibility, transferability, 
dependability, confirmability, and integrity. Credibility refers to whether the reality 
studied was represented adequately, while transferability asks whether the study’s 
hypotheses and findings can be applied in other contexts. Dependability, in its turn, 
considers whether results would be replicated if the study was conducted again with 
similar subjects and contexts. Confirmability seeks to show that a study’s findings derive 
not from the researcher’s preferences or interests, but from the subjects and the field. 
Finally, integrity aims to demonstrate that these findings were not misleading due to 
informants’ misinformation or deception. In Table 3, the techniques used in this study 
are explained. 
Dimension 
Technique 
Credibility 
Prolonged engagement and persistent observation are used as the 
author has been working with blockchain technology since 2017, so 
before the beginning of this study, the context and the phenomenon 
were already understood. Triangulation is also used, as this study 
makes use of different sources and methods, including interviews, 
media articles, and organizational reports. 
Transferability 
The study involved the analysis of three different cases, which were 
led by different, independent organizations, and took place in 
diverse contexts. Despite that, the core findings are shared by all, 
which 
could 
suggest 
their 
transferability 
to 
further 
implementations of blockchain in CVA programs. 

--- Page 37 ---
31 
Dependability 
As the author has been following the cases analyzed for a number 
of years, revisiting them in order to refine their understanding, 
dependability is ensured with observation over time.  
Confirmability 
Confirmability was ensured with the careful documentation of the 
research process, including recording the interviews conducted and 
transcribing them. 
Integrity 
The people interviewed for the study have all worked with matters 
related to Finn Church Aid’s Feasibility Study and are members of 
reputable organizations. Interviewee 1 was still working at FCA and 
suggested the names of Interviewees 2 and 4 as trusted partners. 
Interviewee 2, by his turn, nominated Interviewee 3. The same 
Interview Guide was used for all of them, and their responses were 
consistent. At the beginning of the interviews, respondents were 
informed about how their data would be used and how they would 
not be identified in the study or any published material. Finally, the 
interviews had an average of one hour in duration, which allowed 
them to feel at ease to develop their arguments and responses.

4 DOING NO DIGITAL HARM IN BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CVA 
In this fourth chapter, the findings from Cases A, B, and C (respectively, the World Food 
Programme’s Building Blocks, Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash, and Finn Church Aid’s 
Feasibility Study), are presented. The first section of the chapter is focused on 
establishing the background of the programs under investigation. After that, each section 
is dedicated to one of the major themes that emerged from the data collected, namely 
efficiency, transparency, privacy, biometrics, and disintermediation. 
4.1 
Case descriptions 
In this section, a brief description of each of the three cases investigated is given. Each 
description includes information about the implementing organization, the location and 
target population of each program, as well as its process of aid distribution and the basic 
structure of their supply chains, following the model proposed by Heaslip et al. (2015).    
4.1.1 Case A: the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks 
The largest blockchain-based cash distribution system in the humanitarian sector is the 
World Food Programme’s Building Blocks (Document A6), using a private, permissioned 
system (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). Launched in 2017 in the Sindh province in Pakistan 
(Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020), it is currently active in Bangladesh and Jordan, 
where it serves, respectively, Rohingya and Syrian refugees (Document A5). As of the end 
of 2021, the program had served over 1,000,000 refugees and processed USD 309 
million in cash transfers (Document A5).  
In the first wide implementation of the program, in the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan, a 
system for cash and voucher assistance already existed, and parts of it were modified to 
incorporate blockchain technology (Document A3). Previously, bank accounts were 
created for each beneficiary, who would be provided with debit cards or e-vouchers to be 
used in authorized local shops. In the stores, beneficiaries would be identified with 
optical biometric authentication or one-time passwords sent to their mobile devices 
(Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020), and vendors would receive the payment from the 
bank. After blockchain was incorporated into the system, the bank accounts were 
replaced with e-wallets; this shift from bank accounts to e-wallets did not change how 
beneficiaries received assistance (Document A3). The new process of aid distribution can 
be summarized as follows (Awan & Nunhuck, 2020): 

--- Page 39 ---
33 
1. Virtual wallets are created for beneficiaries, based on their biometric information 
from the UNHCR refugee database; the WFP sends the funds to these e-wallets. 
2. Beneficiaries have their irises scanned to verify their identity when purchasing 
goods at shops registered with the Building Blocks program. 
3. After consulting the transactions recorded on the blockchain, the WFP 
reimburses the due amount to the retailers. That reimbursement is made via 
traditional financial institutions. 
The Building Blocks supply chain is represented in Figure 8. Green arrows represent 
financial flows, while blue and orange represent, respectively, informational and 
material ones.  
 
Figure 8 
The Building Blocks supply chain 
In 2019, the WFP established a partnership with UN Gender to expand the Building 
Blocks to a cash-for-work program for Syrian refugee women in two camps in Jordan, 
Azraq and Za’atari (Document A1). This implementation works in a similar manner to 
that described above, in which the beneficiaries can use their biometrics to purchase 
goods at the participating shops. It has, nevertheless, an additional feature, which is the 
possibility of withdrawing cash from the market (Document A2). Between June 2019 and 
April 2020, 467 women participated in the pilot version of that program (Document A2). 
According to Coppi and Fast (2019), the new system is safer, removing the need for 
women and UN staff to physically carry cash on predetermined distribution dates, as well 
as being more transparent. It is also meant to be more empowering for women, as it 
would allow them to manage their own accounts.

4.1.2 Case B: Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash 
Another case using blockchain for cash transfers is Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash Project, 
which was implemented in Port Vila, Republic of Vanuatu in 2019, in partnership with 
company ConsenSys and startup Sempo (Document B1). UnBlocked Cash is not the only 
Oxfam initiative implementing blockchain technology. The organization has developed 
concepts or pilots on at least five other occasions, with uses ranging from fundraising to 
the tracking and certification of products such as rice and strawberries (Document B2).  
The blockchain pilot was built upon an existing cash transfer project (Document B2). In 
it, beneficiaries received physical cards with near-field communication (NFC) chips, 
which were preloaded with DAI stablecoins, and vendors were provided with 
smartphones (Document B2). The card system was designed as such in response to the 
low internet connectivity on the island (Document B1). In the pilot, aid was delivered in 
the following manner (Document B1): 
1. Oxfam Australia purchased DAI stablecoins in the amount equivalent to the one 
that would be distributed to beneficiaries. Nevertheless, as the use of 
cryptocurrencies was not allowed by the government of Vanuatu, the DAI were 
“wrapped” in a Crypto Collaterised Voucher (CCV) – meaning that they were sent 
to an escrow smart contract. 
2. The CVVs were assigned to beneficiaries, and the NFC cards were loaded with a 
value equivalent, at the date of the beginning of the program, to 49,24 AUD.  
3.  The NFC cards were distributed to beneficiaries, who could then redeem goods 
or services from the partner vendors. To complete the purchases, vendors would 
scan the QR codes printed on the cards. 
4. Vendors exchanged the CVV tokens received from beneficiaries for cash, 
receiving the money either by direct bank transfer from Oxfam or by cashing out 
at designated Super Vendors – larger partner vendors, who would later be 
reimbursed by the humanitarian organization. 
These financial, material and informational flows are represented, respectively, by the 
green, orange and blue lines in Figure 9.

4.1.3 Case C: Finn Church Aid’s Feasibility Study 
Case C refers to the Feasibility Study conducted by Finn Church Aid and Solita in 2019 
in Kenya. The project was designed to test how blockchain could be used to distribute 
cash-based assistance, with emphasis on the aspects of efficiency and donation tracking 
(Document C2). The idea was to create an end-to-end digital system, which would start 
with individuals making donations through an app or website (Interviewee 3). Virtual 
wallets would be created for each beneficiary, who could go to verified retailers and buy 
the products of their choice using either biometrics or a card as a means of identification. 
As each transaction made by beneficiaries was monitored, donors would be able to 
receive information on how the assistance was used (Document C1). In Figure 10, the 
proposed flow of money, information, and goods is represented, respectively, by the 
colors green, blue, and orange.  
 

--- Page 42 ---
36 
Figure 10 
The Finn Church Aid-Solita supply chain  
Despite the intention to create an end-to-end digital system, the team in charge of the 
project decided to start by testing only on the last-mile part of the relief chain in the 
Kenya Feasibility Study. According to Interviewee 3:  
Our vision at the end of the day, that was that “OK, like, let's do like, baby steps”. You know like, 
we know that at the end of the day, what we want to have is like fully, digitalized kind of a delivery 
system. But we also understood that, OK, there's going to be a lot, plenty of hurdles over here, so 
let's just sort of like, and it's going to be also costing a bit so, let's just, like, let's put some of it into 
blockchain. (Interviewee 3) 
As explained by Interviewee 3, the Feasibility Study followed a small proof-of-concept 
between the FCA Head Office and the Myanmar Office, in which FCA and Solita tested 
whether it would be possible to deliver funds using blockchain. That experiment was 
considered successful, thus creating the need for understanding how it could be turned 
into an actual humanitarian program. According to Interviewee 2, several countries were 
considered for the implementation, including Myanmar and South Sudan. Ultimately, it 
was decided that Kenya would be a suitable location, due to reasons such as the 
popularity of digital payments like M-Pesa in the country, as well as a more stable 
political situation and easier access to the places where the Feasibility Study would be 
conducted. More specifically, the feasibility study took place in the cities of Lodwar and 
Lokichar, as well as the Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei settlement (Document C2). 
4.2 Achieving efficiency through cost and time savings 
As previously noted, the aspect of efficiency is highly emphasized in the techno-
optimistic discourse on the use of blockchain in cash and voucher assistance. In the 
reporting of the cases investigated in this study – both those coming from the 
humanitarian organizations themselves and those reported in the media –, that 
emphasis was confirmed. 
In Case A, the new mode of back-end data processing has led to substantial cost savings 
for the WFP, with a reported 98% monthly reduction in bank-related fees (Document 
A3). By the end of 2021, that amounted to up to USD 2.4 million in savings in bank fees, 
with 14 million transactions made using the blockchain system (Document A5). 
According to the Programme, the system makes cash transfers “faster, cheaper and more 
secure” while “increasing transparency and accountability” (Document A6, p. 22). 
In Case B, 187 households participated in the trial, as well as 29 twenty shops, in two 
different communities in Vanuatu, with a total of 11,896.91 Australian Dollars being 

--- Page 43 ---
37 
distributed to beneficiaries (Document B1). The project’s time savings related to 
operational activities were considered significant, while cost savings were deemed 
modest (Document B1). Notably, the time required to onboard an aid recipient was 
reduced from over an hour per individual to an average of 3.6 minutes. Overall, the 
quality of the solution was reported as “extremely high” (Document B1, p. 4). 
The interviews conducted in this study have shown that the Feasibility Study of Case C 
was undertaken due to a general desire for improvement and efficiency in the 
humanitarian sector rather than the existence of a specific problem to be solved. 
According to Interviewee 1: 
We wanted to test improved ways to deliver our humanitarian cash assistance. (...) I cannot say 
with certainty that we faced any issues, particularly not FCA on its own. I believe the humanitarian 
community has been sort of identifying obstacles that somehow could all, or most, be resolved by 
using blockchain technology. (Interviewee 1) 
In Cases A and B, the term “efficiency” was not used with particular precision in the 
documents analyzed. Nevertheless, the reports suggest that efficiency includes aspects 
such as speed and cost – which were echoed by the interviewees in Case C. Reflecting on 
the motivations for Finn Church to use the technology, Interviewee 2 stated that: 
There was a promise that FCA had recognized and had thought about, this promise of using 
blockchain to make things faster. So, in this sense, faster is more efficient, delivering, instead of 
using lots of different middlemen in the process, and then that's slowing down the process of 
delivering aid. So that was one promise, then another one was being more efficient in the sense 
that more economic value is delivered to the recipient in the end, and not so much on these 
different players in between. (Interviewee 2) 
Interviewee 4, however, has noted that other systems, such as mobile payments, can 
likely be as efficient as blockchain. As such, cost and time savings would not be enough, 
by themselves, to justify the use of that technology: 
These other money transfer systems, because nowadays other money transfer systems are also so 
fast. I send money to [home country], like, and it goes so fast, within, you know, an hour or less, 
and the cost is also so little. So, it makes sense that blockchain is used to avoid the banking, but 
then I don't know if it can compete with these other money transfer systems nowadays we see in 
the market. (Interviewee 4) 
Regarding efficiency, Interviewee 3 shared the views of Interviewees 1 and 2 and 
emphasized the aspect of speed and time savings. For him, blockchain could enable 
humanitarian organizations to respond faster to disasters, especially when there are 
limitations on the affected country’s banking system.

4.3 Transparency as accountability to donors 
When addressing the aspect of transparency, all the documents and interviews analyzed 
referred to it as a major benefit not only in the abstract but with the specific purpose of 
increasing donors’ trust in a program.  
In Case A, the WFP has a record of every transaction that happens at each participating 
shop, which is reported as a way to increase accountability to donors (Document A2), to 
whom transactions can be made visible. In Case B, each transaction is recorded in the 
Ethereum mainnet, which is a public blockchain, theoretically accessible to anyone 
interested in the information (Document B1). In addition to that, Sempo, Oxfam’s 
technology partner, developed a dashboard for the program, which allowed real-time 
monitoring of transactions and facilitated compliance with donor requirements such as 
Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) (Document B1).  
Similarly, transparency was a benefit often emphasized by the respondents interviewed 
in Case C. Interviewee 3 has explained that one of the main reasons for FCA’s interest in 
testing blockchain was to see how it much more transparent it could make a cash and 
voucher program:  
Another thing was that there was a question of, like, “how do you actually, like, how transparent 
can you actually make these?” (…) One of the things that the humanitarian field always gets 
criticized about – even if in actual terms it's actually super transparent compared to many other 
fields of work – but anyway, that's sort of a deal, the thing that you need to be dealing with. So, I 
was thinking, like, is it possible that we would actually like put, start pushing the money, instead 
of using the, like, traditional banking routes, and actually put it simply to blockchain? (Interviewee 
3) 
Interviewee 2 has also spoken about how transparency was one of the main drivers for 
conducting the Feasibility Study: 
And then one more was around the idea of transparency, so this kind of way of delivering maybe 
could provide means of following better what money goes where and how is it used, and how much 
of it goes where, so it could in this sense enable better control of how much the person donates 
gets delivered in the end, and so in this, better control of what happens in the process. So those 
were kind of the initial hypotheses of benefits that inspired them to move forward. (Interviewee 2) 
For FCA, the transparency that could be brought with the implementation of blockchain 
was intended to work on multiple levels, including that of being able to prove to donors 
that beneficiaries were not misusing the aid received. Interviewee 1 has explained that: 
A lot of people, or donors, let's say, are sort of skeptical about what the people do with the money. 
And there is skepticism about if people are just spending the money on things that they shouldn't 
be, or what it's not meant to be spent for. (…) Because of the traceability of the blockchain nature, 
it is easy to track and see where the money is spent, and by this, I don't mean that we are just 
watching and knowing who is doing what, but it is the way to visualize that the money is spent in 
shops, where they're like, grocery shops (…). But at bottom line is that this transparency is 

--- Page 45 ---
39 
definitely useful for sort of unveiling this sort of preconceived notions that people misuse the cash 
when they're given it or the possibility to buy what they want. (Interviewee 1)  
Nevertheless, Interviewee 4 has argued that blockchain is not the only system that can 
provide such a level of transparency to donors. According to him, if donors trust FCA and 
there are no other parties involved in adding data to the system, there are less costly and 
easier ways to show how the resources received are being used:   
If you have a, in a centralized system, everything, all data, like, to whom you provided the money, 
or who bought what from the marketplace, if you have it in a centralized system of FCA, that could 
be also used to show the donor. I mean, that's no difference between having a blockchain and a 
centralized system. There is no difference there, in my opinion. (Interviewee 4) 
Similarly to the aspect of efficiency previously mentioned, Interviewees 1, 2, and 3 share 
a more optimistic view, while Interviewee 4 reiterated the possibility of using systems 
other than blockchain to achieve the same goal. 
4.3.1 Opacity for beneficiaries 
Although general transparency and accountability to donors are reported as advantages 
by the documents analyzed in all cases, the aspect of transparency for beneficiaries is 
rarely addressed in these materials. In Case A, the documents present somewhat 
contradictory information regarding the level of transparency provided to beneficiaries. 
On the one hand, the official Jordan Case Study reports that all 114 respondents of its 
December 2019 midline assessment “confirmed that they are regularly informed when 
entitlements are added to their balances by UN Women Staff” (Document A2, p. 8). 
Document A1 reports that, in the Azraq Camp, the participating women interviewed by 
Cheesman have complained about how they did not have access to detailed information 
about their earnings: 
“We never know what each salary payment is for, we might think it’s for this month and it might 
be for the previous one,” Aya, one of the senior seamstresses, said. Her colleague Fatima added, 
“We wish there was clear information somewhere telling us how much we received based on how 
many days of work, and when we received it, and how much we withdrew and if there’s anything 
left.” (Document A1)      
In that implementation, still according to Document A1, while the supermarket receipts 
contained the amount that had been withdrawn and the remaining balance of the 
account, they did not include key aspects for beneficiaries, such as payment dates, and 
what the payments were for. Because of that, women participating in the program would 
collect the receipts and create their own systems to document how many hours they had 
worked and what they estimated that their payments should be: 

--- Page 46 ---
40 
Women kept the receipts safely in their bras during the workday and brought them out when 
discussing or contesting salary issues with GEN or the supermarket cashiers. Many times, women 
workers took receipts out to show me, the thin paper folded to prevent the ink from rubbing off. 
The information on the receipts was printed in Roman script and English numerals. Almost none 
of the refugee women workers spoke English, but accounting practices were usually collective, 
relying on those who could best interpret the information. (…) Rather than empowering refugee 
workers with a new accounting tool, GEN’s implementation of blockchain introduced new 
challenges for their financial management. Refugee workers incorporated receipts into their 
arsenal of socio-technical resources where the blockchain ledger was nowhere to be seen. 
(Document A1) 
In Case B, beneficiaries only had access to the NFC card, but it was not possible for 
participants to check their balances as they had no access to the Sempo information 
dashboard (Document B1). Although it would still be possible for them to try to find the 
relevant transactions in the public Ethereum network, that was likely not a realistic 
option, given the high degree of technical knowledge required for it. 
From the interviews conducted for Case C, it was not possible to determine whether 
beneficiaries would have access to the information stored on the blockchain. As the 
project was not implemented, the respondents could not say with certainty how it would 
have worked. Nevertheless, Interviewee 1 expressed surprise when told that other cases 
do not make account information visible to beneficiaries:   
There has to be a tracking, and that's exactly what the best thing that blockchain has is that it's a 
transparent, transparent tracker of any sort of actions that take place. So, I find it hard to believe 
that it was an issue that, you know, it wasn't able to be verifiable. So, I suppose that if you request 
it from the teller, from the person that has the reader, you should be able to. (Interviewee 1) 
A potential reason for that lack of transparency is the general notion by humanitarian 
organizations that beneficiaries would not be able to understand the information even if 
it was made available to them. According to Document A1, in Case A: 
But no one explained the blockchain to these women workers: as a concept, GEN staff treated 
blockchain on a “need to know basis,” deeming the technical complexity inappropriate because of 
workers’ mixed literacy and numeracy skills and technical capacities. (…) When their eyes were 
scanned by the supermarket cashier using an EyePay machine (…), the biometric check 
authenticated the transaction by triggering a cryptographic private key — which the women did 
not know they had. Refugee women workers made new data points whenever they completed a 
transaction, but the ledger was not made visible to them. The only transaction records they were 
able to access were the paper receipts provided by supermarket cashiers. (Document A1)  
In Case B, the project has acknowledged that “not everyone served by the Sempo 
platform has access or the literacy to comprehend the information stored on the 
network” (Document B1, p. 13), and the same idea was echoed in Case C. When asked 
about how much beneficiaries needed to know about the program, Interviewee 1 replied: 
You just have to explain the concepts and the mechanisms. So just that and understand why they're 
getting the assistance. But beyond that, I don't think it is necessary to have a deep understanding 
of the technology in itself. But they do have to understand, you know, how much money they have, 
how they can use it, when they can use it and where, and for how long they will be getting that. So, 

--- Page 47 ---
41 
these are the things that are sort of essential for the communities to understand. But the 
technology at hand? Not really. (Interviewee 1) 
While Interviewee 2 did not go into detail about this, the fact that many beneficiaries 
were illiterate was mentioned. According to him, FCA has even experimented with using 
symbols instead of numbers as pin codes in order to allow for more beneficiary 
participation. In that context, it is thus unlikely that participants would be informed 
about the use of blockchain in the system. Interviewees 3 and 4 did not discuss the 
matter. 
4.4 A privacy-enhancing or surveillance-enabling technology? 
With regard to privacy, all cases considered have highlighted how blockchain technology 
can be used to enhance beneficiary privacy. The exact manner in which that is done, 
however, varies depending on the project. 
In Case A, the use of blockchain is argued to lead to better protection of beneficiary data, 
especially as it reduces third-party involvement (Document A2). The WFP only has 
access to an anonymized, hashed version of the beneficiaries’ personal information, 
which is used to validate transactions at the participating retailers; the database 
containing personal data is managed by the UNHCR (Coppi & Fast, 2019). The payment 
history is registered on the Ethereum blockchain, which is considered a quicker and more 
efficient way to identify issues with payments and balances and resolve them (Document 
A2).    
In Case B, on the other hand, Oxfam has access to beneficiary data, but it has chosen to 
not register it on the blockchain (Document B2), nor the details of transactions beyond 
the general category of purchases (Baharmand et al., 2021b). Reducing the amount of 
personal beneficiary data available to third parties could thus increase privacy.  
Blockchain’s privacy-enhancing potential was brought up by interviewees in Case C. 
According to Interviewee 1: 
Another appealing aspect of blockchain technology is the ability that blockchain has, not only 
because it's transparent and traceable, but because you're able to share information and you select 
what information you want to share. It's not, it's unlike when you know you get stopped in the 
streets and you show your ID that says your name, your age, where you were born, and a lot of 
other information that perhaps might be sensitive. This is a way for people to sort of protect their 
information and their identity. (Interviewee 1) 
Nevertheless, the interviewees have also acknowledged that beneficiary privacy could 
become a point of concern if the transparency of blockchain were to be misused as a 
surveillance tool. For Interviewee 3: 

--- Page 48 ---
42 
It is so easy to actually follow it up, like where it's going. Like, you could, theoretically speaking, 
let's say you have, you have FCA head office over here, you have your country office here. Here you 
have, say, let's say that you operate fully on crypto. So then what you have is like the merchants in 
the field. And then you have the people who have the wallet, practically the beneficiaries, and they 
go with that, like, you can follow up real time what they're buying from the store, and I think that 
that will… There will actually be a pretty big issue like, like you need to be anonymizing, doing 
those sort of protection issues. (Interviewee 3) 
Interviewee 1, while recognizing this potential risk, has highlighted that the precise 
extent of the availability of information depends on each particular implementation and 
the design choices informing it: 
It's a bit controversial because of course there are some grey areas there as to how much do we 
really need to know. (…) There are donors or, I don't know, agencies that may not purposely want 
to sort of go that deep into the transparency aspect, and not sort of provide too much information 
just as a means to just sort of provide help without there being, some kind of fishbowl for the 
beneficiaries that receive it. (Interviewee 1) 
Interviewee 2 explained that the consideration of privacy risks and surveillance was part 
of FCA’s risk assessment during the Feasibility Study. Interviewee 4, in his turn, 
expanded on a point made by Interviewee 1, which was how the level of transparency in 
the system can be chosen by humanitarian organizations and donors.  
4.5 Designing CVA with and without biometrics 
Within all major themes analyzed, the use of biometrics for identifying beneficiaries was 
the aspect with the most variation between the cases under investigation – and, as will 
be explained in Chapter 5, the one that diverges most from the relevant literature.  
In Case A, biometrics are the main way used by beneficiaries to receive aid (Document 
A3). Because of that, neither an active internet connection nor smartphones are required 
from beneficiaries, which can be argued to make the program more inclusive. Beyond 
inclusion, in the implementation by UN Women, a baseline survey with beneficiaries has 
reported that they feel safer with the biometric process (Document A2). 
Interestingly, the WFP had been using biometrics for payments in Jordan refugee camps 
since 2016 (Document A2). The identity of beneficiaries was verified through iris 
scanning, and after the confirmation that the beneficiary’s account had enough funds, 
purchases were authorized at partner shops (Document 2). The basic structure in that 
implementation was very similar to the one later used in the Building Blocks program; 
in fact, the only difference between them is that in the first case, the account balance was 
checked with the Jordan Ahli Bank and the payments were made via the Middle East 
Payment Services, instead of using blockchain technology (WFP, 2016).    

--- Page 49 ---
43 
In Case B, they are not used at all, and no biometric information was collected from 
beneficiaries (Document B2). As NFC cards were distributed to them, neither an active 
internet connection nor smartphones were required (Document B1).  
Finally, in Case C, biometrics were pointed out as the method of access most likely to be 
chosen if FCA decided to implement the plan discussed in the Feasibility Study 
(Interviewee 3), with interviewees highlighting several advantages of the use of 
biometrics. The first, along the same lines as Case A, is that they could be a way to make 
programs more inclusive, making it possible for humanitarian organizations to reach, for 
instance, undocumented people. According to Interviewee 1: 
Another one is we often work with people who are on the move, people who have been suddenly 
displaced, and we work with people who are undocumented, and it is in these situations where 
using biometric means of payment for the cash that we provide could bypass a huge obstacle, huge 
obstacle that in occasions when people do not have any ID, they might not even be included in any 
assistance, so they are vulnerable in every single way because they're not in any system. They have 
other difficulties opening a bank account or getting, I don't know, like, a phone connection or doing 
any sort of transactions when they're undocumented. (Interviewee 1) 
The interviewees have also argued that biometrics can be safer for beneficiaries. 
Interviewee 3 has explained that: 
But say, if we were, like, if we were planning to work on like, based on biometric. So, say that you 
have a grocery store over here, you have your beneficiary over here, and in the middle you have a 
hostile checkpoint. Then your person can actually just, because he or she has biometrics, like, you 
don't need to have any kind of a card, any kind of cash, like, anything that sort of gives up the fact 
that, OK, that you are carrying something of value on you, so... (Interviewee 3) 
That safety is also extended to cases in which humanitarian organizations have to 
cooperate with others in order to provide aid to beneficiaries. In those, blockchain could 
enable cooperation without having to expose personal data. Interviewee 1 argued that: 
That's the difficulty where I was getting at, blockchain could help resolve, because in this, because, 
you know, usually people, or many NGOs, they store their data on databases. So you would sort of, 
today, let's say somebody has to share, so they would just hide several columns and just leave the 
names or just leave the phone numbers, or any sort of what we call single identifier. (…) Having a 
platform like blockchain, where we could cross-check information without really exposing any 
extra information in order to sort of, and maximize our resources and not duplicate, would be to 
sort of have a shared platform. (Interviewee 1) 
Nevertheless, respondents have also acknowledged that the use of biometrics brings a 
degree of risk. For the interviewees, risk factors arose mostly from exceptional situations, 
i.e. they do not consider biometrics a source of major systemic risk. The risk most often 
cited was the possibility of the technology not working for certain groups of people. 
According to Interviewee 1:   
Perhaps people who are disabled or who are not, sometimes the, if we're doing, let's say 
fingerprints and there's people that, because they work with their hands or for whatever reason, 

--- Page 50 ---
44 
there could be some sort of exceptions where the technology may not sort of function. (Interviewee 
1) 
A similar situation was verified by Interviewee 2 during the fieldwork of the Feasibility 
Study. He recalled that: 
When we were there with a community of elderly people, they have many experiences of these 
devices not working. So this, the biometric device is not working, when you go and you should now 
get your, you’re entitled to go and collect the money, but you cannot because they're not working, 
and they were really frustrated about them. And then, it was also interesting that they have 
explanations why they thought that they weren't working. So, people were saying that they had 
worked for all the life in manual labor, so their fingerprints are worn out. So that's why the devices 
cannot recognize anything, because they're kind of blank. (Interviewee 2) 
Another potential risk identified by respondents in Case C was that of family conflicts 
arising from a change in power dynamics. Such a change in power dynamics, 
interestingly, were the same ones considered positive in Case A when women were the 
registered beneficiaries, and thus the ones in control of the aid received (Document A2). 
According to Interviewee 1: 
So, for example, if the man is the dominating head of household and then we want to have a gender 
balance and different, other humanitarian principles applied, and we choose to deliver to women 
alone. Then in that case, it could possibly, potentially create some tensions there. But again, I don't 
think this is… But I think yeah, it is a bit related specifically to blockchain because many cases 
when, you know the family, receives the money, we have one main person as the recipient, as the 
head of the household. But then they can still sort of distribute some of the responsibility of the 
shopping or the, whatever the amount. There's not so much of a “only I can get the cash with the 
finger”. So, basically, maybe it could, yeah, maybe it could just put additional pressure in family 
dynamics. (Interviewee 1) 
Interviewee 2 has added another example to the issue of family dynamics, citing cases of 
mobile payment systems in which funds were misused because the only literate family 
members were children or young people. Interviewees 3 and 4 did not go into detail 
about this point.  
4.6 Disintermediation from traditional financial actors 
In Case A, the intermediaries used before the implementation of blockchain in the 
program, the banks, are not removed from the supply chain. Nevertheless, the 
transactions in which they participate are processed in bulk in the new system 
(Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020) when the WFP sends the financial amount owed 
to the participating shops (Thylin & Duarte, 2019). Still, the vision for Building Blocks is 
that it would eventually become a “neutral” platform, owned by the participating 
humanitarian organizations, in which payments could be coordinated without relying on 
traditional financial institutions (Martin et al., 2022, p. 19).  

--- Page 51 ---
45 
These intermediaries are also present in Case B. As Vanuatu’s Reserve Bank crypto 
prohibition had outlawed the use of crypto wallets and currencies in the country (Jutel, 
2021), vendors were still required to have bank accounts to receive reimbursements from 
Oxfam. In one of the project’s research reports, it was concluded that the pilot “did not 
disintermediate when compared to Oxfam’s standard process” (Document B1, p. 46). The 
report has also suggested that vendors could be encouraged to exchange the DAI 
stablecoin received for fiat currencies through third-party exchanges instead of cashing 
out with banks to reduce the use of traditional financial institutions (Document B1).  
In Case C, the fact that these institutions would still likely be needed in the program was 
recognized. According to Interviewee 3, that point was considered by FCA:  
It is fast if you operate on crypto. It's super fast. So you can sort of bypass all that thing. You have 
the total ownership of the thing, you need don't need to be relying on the banks. (…) The worry 
that we had at FCA was that, OK, you put it into blockchain, but then at some stage you actually 
still need to be putting it into the regular banking system because we're not operating on crypto. 
So, it's sort of, at the end of the day, if you don't go full crypto, I think you're not going to be able 
to make it at the end of the day in a way that it will make, like, really make sense. (Interviewee 3) 
Regarding disintermediation, the statements from Interviewee 1 were not clear. On the 
one hand, she argued that blockchain could help to include unbanked beneficiaries, 
suggesting that traditional financial institutions could be bypassed, at least to a certain 
extent. On the other hand, a functioning banking system was considered an important 
factor when determining whether a given context would be suitable for the 
implementation of a blockchain-based CVA program. 
Interviewee 2 did not discuss the matter, while Interviewee 4 had an opinion similar to 
that of Interviewee 3, emphasizing how blockchain should allow for a reduction of the 
participation of traditional financial institutions in the humanitarian supply chain.

Table 5 Summary of case findings 
4.8 Updated theoretical framework 
In Chapter 2, Figure 5 displayed the theoretical framework developed for this study after 
the analysis of Cases A and B and the review of the relevant academic literature – which 
constituted the first two steps of the abductive research method used. Following the 
analysis of both interview transcripts and documents from Case C, that framework was 
updated, and its new version can be found in Figure 11. The main considerations 
regarding the update are as follows: 
• 
With the exception of better decision-making and more resilient humanitarian 
supply chains, which were factors only found in the literature, all previously 
mentioned benefits were confirmed by documents and interviews. The point 
regarding improved traceability and accountability was modified to reflect how 
that benefit is accrued by donors, but not by beneficiaries. 
• 
As previously mentioned, neither documents nor interviewees have detailed the 
risks that the implementation of blockchain technology for the delivery of CVA 
programs can pose to beneficiaries. Still, the factors impossibility of modification 
or exclusion of data, opacity for beneficiaries, lack of technical knowledge in 
humanitarian organizations, surveillance and function creep, and dependency 
on technical partners were confirmed. Most risks, such as loss of dignity, 
increased volume of data collection, and violation of humanitarian principles 
by new HSC actors were only present in the literature on the subject. 

--- Page 54 ---
48 
Nevertheless, as these risks might still prove to be significant, they continue to be 
part of the study’s theoretical framework. 
• 
Two core characteristics (digital technology and biometrics), as well as their 
respective benefits and risks, were added. The benefits brought by the use of a 
digital technology are the same as those that result from decentralization, albeit 
from different reasons. Regarding the main risks from that characteristic, both 
exclusion of already vulnerable groups and technology malfunction were factors 
mentioned only in the interviews conducted. Finally, although it is recognized 
that biometrics are not necessary for the implementation of blockchain in CVA 
programs, that characteristic is viewed in such a different manner by the 
literature and the practitioners from humanitarian organizations that it was 
considered that it should be addressed in its own.

5 DISCUSSION 
In this Chapter 5, the findings of the analysis of Cases A, B, and C, and described in 
Chapter 4 are discussed using the literature reviewed in Chapter 2. The discussion is 
based on the five key points shown in the updated theoretical framework of Figure 11, 
namely immutability, distribution, decentralization, digital technology, and biometrics. 
Following that, a set of seven measures is suggested for humanitarian organizations 
working with blockchain-based CVA programs in order to minimize the potential digital 
risks posed to beneficiaries.   
5.1 
Risks arising from immutability 
The first risk related to the immutability of data registered on the blockchain is that of 
the impossibility of modification or exclusion of data, even in when such data is 
inaccurate or incorrect, as explained by Zwitter and Boisse-Despiaux (2018). Although 
the literature raises it as a key point of concern, especially as this immutability can be 
seen as a conflict between blockchain-based systems and data protection regulations 
such as the European GDPR (ICRC, 2020), the three cases analyzed seem to have been 
able to avoid major issues in this regard. As previously explained, neither Case A nor 
Case B register beneficiary personal data on chain, and while it is not possible to say if 
the same would occur in Case C, the respondents interviewed in this study seemed at 
least aware of the fact that such registration should be avoided. The notion that 
implementations that do not register identifiable personal information on the blockchain 
could avoid data protection issues was confirmed by Interviewee 4:  
It really depends how the system is designed. Like, if you cannot, if you are not identifying the 
person with their identity, like, and somehow if you do not really show it to the donor, or if you do 
not… If you maintain the privacy, in simple word, then I do not really see any problem on that. 
(Interviewee 4) 
It is clear, therefore, how much the design choices made by the humanitarian 
organization implementing the program matter, as emphasized by Coppi and Fast 
(2019). Immutability can be dangerous to beneficiaries if their data is registered on the 
blockchain; however, that is not necessary for the functioning of a CVA program. The use 
of workarounds such as off-chain solutions with logical deletion, explained in Chapter 2, 
should suffice from a data protection perspective (ICRC, 2020; Thylin & Duarte, 2019).  
Less clear, however, is the matter of the risk of loss of dignity, as reported by Howson 
(2020). Cash and voucher assistance is seen as empowering to beneficiaries (Heaslip et 
al., 2018), and the general tone of the documents analyzed echoes that. In Document A2, 

--- Page 56 ---
50 
for instance, the UN Women implementation is described as giving participants more 
control over their finances; the project has also included seminars on financial literacy. 
Still, no direct mention of dignity, especially when considering the proportionality of 
using an immutable system to provide temporary benefits, is made by either the 
documents investigated or the respondents interviewed. The lack of mention is perhaps 
due to the abstract nature of the concept, which may be considered to lie within the 
domain of ethics, not operations. It must be noted, however, that this does not mean that 
the matter is not relevant and should not be considered by a humanitarian organization 
implementing a blockchain-based CVA program (Lee, 2020). 
5.2 Risks arising from distribution 
As explained in Chapter 2 and reiterated by all cases examined, transparency is regarded 
as a key benefit of blockchain technology that arises from its distributed nature, 
especially as the humanitarian sector suffers from a lack of it (Baharmand et al.,  2021a). 
Although Coppi and Fast (2019) argue that transparency should not be regarded only as 
a benefit brought by blockchain technology, but as a precondition for its implementation 
in CVA programs, in practice, such transparency is seldom extended to beneficiaries.  
The fact that neither Case A nor Case B have mechanisms that enable beneficiaries to 
visualize their own data or transaction histories, exemplifies this. Although Case C was 
not implemented, the fact that no respondent could explain how the program would 
enable that, and one of the interviewees was in fact surprised to hear that it was 
something that had to be intentionally implemented by the organization seem to suggest 
that such a feature might not have been planned for by FCA and Solita. The risk related 
to the opacity of the system to beneficiaries is, therefore, visible. 
The second risk related to distribution is that of surveillance and function creep, as it 
enables humanitarian organizations to easily share sensitive data with other actors. Once 
that data is shared, it is no longer under the control of the organization and could be 
misused (Burton, 2020), putting beneficiaries at risk (Lee, 2020). As previously 
mentioned, beneficiary personal information is not registered on the blockchain in Cases 
A and B, which greatly reduces this possibility of misuse. Nevertheless, in both cases, 
transaction histories are still registered. Because of that, if a person were to be identified 
– for instance, by combining data from different sources – it would be theoretically 
possible to trace back his or her entire transaction history, which Seyedsayamdost and 
Vanderwal (2020) consider a potential risk. In Case C, although respondents generally 

--- Page 57 ---
51 
reported seeing blockchain as a privacy-enhancing technology, they seemed aware that 
surveillance was a potential risk, and that it should be considered when designing a 
program.  
The possibility of surveillance can be worsened by humanitarian organizations’ tendency 
to collect too much data, as explained by Sandvik et al. (2014). Nevertheless, in the cases 
analyzed in this study, it was not clear whether additional data was collected from 
beneficiaries once blockchain-based systems were deployed, as the projects were 
reported to have been built on top of existing CVA programs. In Case A, in which 
biometrics are used, the previous system already used that type of data (Document A2). 
In Case B, no biometric information was used in the previous program, and that 
remained so after blockchain was introduced (Document B1). It is not possible to say 
what type of data would be collected in Case C if the program was implemented. 
The aspect of distribution shows, yet again, how the levels and types of risks posed to 
beneficiaries depend on program design. Transparency to beneficiaries is not a given, 
but it could be implemented. Surveillance is a possibility, but it can be minimized if less 
data is collected and strict controls over who can access it are implemented. The matter 
of design choices is then reiterated as key, as with the considerations regarding 
immutability made above. 
5.3 Risks arising from decentralization 
In this study, the aspect of decentralization was the one in relation to which the highest 
number of potential risks were identified. These risks are interrelated: the 
disintermediation enabled by decentralization exposes the lack of technical knowledge 
in humanitarian organizations, which can lead to a dependency on technical partners;  
these new actors in the supply chain, in their turn, may violate humanitarian principles. 
At the same time, these same actors replace local players, reducing their role.  
Although no data was found in the documents analyzed in Case A about this matter, it 
was reported in Case B that internal stakeholders had a “large knowledge gap related to 
the technology”; as a result, the project team had to spend “significant time educating 
internal stakeholders about the basics of the technology, including clarifying that Oxfam 
was not in any way going to be using, buying or selling cryptocurrencies” (Document B2, 
p. 3-4). This is in line with the consideration found in the literature that humanitarian 
organizations may lack the technical understanding of the complexity of blockchain 
technology (Lee, 2020), outsourcing it to third parties (Baharmand et al., 2021b). In Case 

--- Page 58 ---
52 
B, the startup Sempo was responsible for the technical parts of the Oxfam program; in 
Case C, the company Solita developed the technology for Finn Church Aid’s Feasibility 
Study. In the latter, Interviewee 1 acknowledged how that can lead to a dependency on 
the partner, stating that: 
Clearly, if we're working with a secondary sort of like, a partner, it also, I mean, you know there 
are things that are going beyond our control. Like, if we were implementing and they for whatever 
reason, bankruptcy, whatever, they sort of are unable to continue, to finish the project, then, of 
course, there's a risk because we are not a technological sort of agency that can resolve that without 
their assistance, so… Then clearly that would also become an issue, to work with a high-level sort 
of technology that we, the primary implementers, are not able to sort of operate without external 
assistance. It makes it, puts us in a dependency sort of position with them. (Interviewee 1) 
Authors such as Jutel (2022), Sandvik et al. (2017), and McDonald (2021) argue how 
problematic a dependency can be on partners that benefit from the humanitarian 
operational license but are not bound by its rules. Commenting on Case B, Jutel states 
that the project “operates alongside the most dubious elements of crypto and against 
government attempts to regulate in the public interest” (2022, p. 2), in reference to the 
participation of the controversial company Consensys. While not specifically relating to 
Case A, the World Food Programme has been criticized for establishing a partnership 
with the company Palantir Technologies, which has been involved in scandals with the 
US Central Intelligence Agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as 
Cambridge Analytica (Burton, 2020; Madianou, 2019). As most documents analyzed in 
this study, however, in all cases, were authored by humanitarian organizations and their 
partners, no mentions of this potential risk of violations of humanitarian principles by 
new HSC actors were found in them. The same was true for the interviews conducted 
with respondents associated with Case C.  
Another risk explored was the fact that, as new, technology-oriented partners emerge, 
the role of downstream actors can be reduced (Coppi, 2020). In the literature review, the 
efficiency gains that arise from blockchain’s decentralization and disintermediation are 
considered alongside the potential risks of bypassing the traditional banking system and 
reducing the role of local actors (Baharmand et al., 2021b; Thylin & Duarte, 2019; Coppi 
& Fast, 2019). Mentions of potential downsides, however, were scant in the documents 
analyzed and interviews conducted. In Case A only, the organization responsible for the 
project has acknowledged that local financial sectors could be negatively affected using 
blockchain (Document A3).  
Nevertheless, it must be noted that, although the cases analyzed have achieved some 
degree of decentralization, there are currently no cases in which the system is fully digital 

--- Page 59 ---
53 
end-to-end (Coppi & Fast, 2019), or that do not require some level of interaction with 
traditional financial institutions (Martin et al., 2022). In order to bypass these 
institutions, cryptocurrencies would have to be used by donors, when transferring funds 
to humanitarian organizations, by beneficiaries, when receiving aid, and in all processes 
that happen between those two ends.  
5.4 Risks arising from the use of biometrics 
The most striking differences found in this study between the academic literature and 
the cases investigated are those related to the use of biometrics. In a clear divergence, 
the former is highly critical of its use (Madianou, 2019; Sandvik et al., 2014; Sandvik et 
al., 2017), while biometrics are mostly seen as beneficial in the latter. In both Cases A 
and C, as noted in Chapter 4, biometrics were regarded as a means of inclusion 
(Document A3; Interviewee 1), and as safer for beneficiaries (Document A2; Interviewees 
1 and 3). 
In the literature, the fact that biometrics constitute sensitive personal data that can be 
misused in emphasized (Sandvik et al., 2017). Madianou (2019) argues that biometric 
identification is particularly dangerous as it tends to be outsourced to private partners – 
thus including even more actors in the supply chain that are not bound by humanitarian 
principles. That can be seen in Case A. While Building Blocks is linked to the UNHCR’s 
biometric identity system (Thylin & Duarte, 2019), the entity responsible for the 
technology part of that system is the private company IrisGuard; the iris scans of 2.7 
million Syrian refugees are reported to be held by it (Martin et al, 2022).   
Biometrics were not used in Case B (Documents B1 and B2), and although it would likely 
be used in Case C (Interviewees 2 and 3), respondents in the latter have only identified 
exceptional risks in implementing that method for identification and verification. 
Interviewees 1 and 2 noted the possibility of technology malfunction, and changes in 
family dynamics. The former will be will be commented on next section, which deals with 
the matter of risks that arise from the use of digital technologies. 
With regard to the latter, Cases A and C have diverging accounts of the effects of choosing 
women as the beneficiaries of the assistance. While Case A has considered that it brings 
positive changes in family dynamics (Document A2), Interviewee 1 has noted that it 
could be a source of tension in households. The literature on cash and voucher assistance 
and gender, nevertheless, points out that there is no straightforward answer to the 
question of whether women are empowered when they are responsible for collecting 

--- Page 60 ---
54 
benefits. An evaluation of a cash program in Raqqa, Syria, for example, has shown how 
the results can vary greatly: in some households, women reported greater decision-
making power, while in others, tensions were heightened, especially with in-laws 
(Blackwell et al., 2019).  
5.5 
Risks arising from the use of digital technologies 
Technology malfunction was one of the two risks identified by respondents in Case C 
regarding the use of biometrics. As Sandvik et al. (2014) note, however, due to the 
instability of the environments in which humanitarian operations take place, the risk of 
technology failure is higher. Advanced technologies are seldom designed for that specific 
type of context, so even if a vulnerability is exceptional and not systemic, it should be 
carefully considered. 
The second risk was that of exclusion of already vulnerable groups, such as elderly people 
or manual laborers, whose fingerprints are often not recognized by biometric scanners 
(Interviewees 1 and 2). In the literature review, it is noted that, although such a risk is 
not specific to the blockchain, it must be considered because the analysis of a 
technology’s implementation cannot be done without consideration of the social context 
in which it occurs (Lee, 2020). Digital payments, and by extension, systems that make 
use of blockchain wallets, are less accessible than cash since they must be directly linked 
to the beneficiary’s identity, opening the possibility of exclusion and discrimination 
(Martin & Taylor, 2021). This exclusion can lead to a digital divide (Baharmand et al., 
2021b). 
5.6 Guidelines for Humanitarian Organizations 
The onus of proving that the implementation of a given technology will not cause harm 
belongs to the humanitarian organization conducting it (Sandvik et al., 2017), and while 
it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of digital harm, the risk factors 
that constitute it can be mitigated (Burton, 2020). Because of this, the following seven 
measures are suggested to humanitarian organizations working with the use of 
blockchain for the delivery of cash and voucher assistance. Each measure is directly 
related to the risks identified in this study, as shown in Figure 12. A more detailed 
description of each measure is presented in the sections following it.

Figure 12 
Summary of recommendations and the risks addressed by them  
5.6.1 Consider whether a blockchain-based system is, in fact, needed 
Blockchains should not be seens as a “universal governance principle capable of solving 
all manner of social issues” (Jutel, 2022, p. 3), or as applicable to every given situation. 
In order for distributed systems to be used in ways that can provide the most benefits, 
certain conditions should be present, including: (a) a set of transactions that must be 
recorded and (b) involve multiple parties that (c) have to collaborate while (d) there is 
no trusted central authority or third party in the system (ICRC, 2020). In cases where all 
the parties involved trust each other, for example, there is no need for blockchain to be 
implemented, and the use of a traditional database would be easier and cheaper to 

--- Page 62 ---
56 
implement, more efficient and safer for beneficiaries. Both Cases A and B analyzed in 
this study have been criticized for not meeting all of these criteria. 
Although the Building Blocks program started in the public Ethereum network, it became 
a private and permissioned implementation due to high fees and slow transactions; in 
the private version, WFP controlled all the nodes in the network (Document A4). Later, 
UN Women joined the network and started to run as an independent node  (Thylin & 
Duarte, 2019). Nevertheless, as UN Women is a trusted partner, the benefits that 
blockchain could bring to the program are not clear. This criticism was confirmed by 
Houman Haddad, the creator of the Building Blocks program, who has stated that “of 
course, we could do all of what we’re doing today without using blockchain” (Document 
A4). Still, Robert Opp, an executive at WFP, has defended the program by explaining that 
it is just the beginning of a process of experimentation with blockchain technology:  
If our endpoint was to do exactly what we’re doing right now on 100,000 Syrian refugees on a 
digital voucher system in Jordan, then doing it with a database may well be cheaper. But this is 
not the end point for us. This is a beginning point. (Stanley, 2018)   
In Case B, the fact that the system used was private and controlled by only one partner 
(Sempo, the software company), was acknowledged as a single point of failure 
(Baharmand et al, 2021b). When commenting on the case, Jutel argued that private 
systems that do not require mining or consensus algorithms, are “the epitome of a 
database masquerading as a blockchain” (Jutel, 2022, p. 3). For him, given the project’s 
“highly-intermediated” blockchain (…)” (Jutel, 2022, p.7), “it is not self-evident what 
virtues blockchain might have over mobile telephony payment systems (…) which can 
operate under existing financial regulations and communications infrastructure” (Jutel, 
2021, p. 7). 
In Case C, the concern of whether blockchain would be the most adequate technology for 
the project was only voiced by Interviewee 4. According to him: 
In general, if there is only one entity, only one, then the whole concept of blockchain is gone, to be 
honest. Like, blockchain is about, you know, multiple entities and then the trust is shared, or trust 
is rebuilt in the network. But if there is only one entity who can change or write the blockchain 
data whenever they want? That is almost like a centralized system. So, in that sense, you know, it's 
only in a marketing way... You can say that that you are using blockchain and it's a great thing, but 
deep down you are doing basically a centralized system, so… In my view, yeah, that's… I don't 
know, I do not really see much benefit in a situation like this. (…) In that sense, the real value of 
blockchain is almost gone. (Interviewee 4) 
The implementation of a blockchain solution should be based on concrete evidence and 
weighed against alternatives that make use of different systems (Coppi & Fast, 2019). If 
a humanitarian organization fails to do so, a complex and expensive system might be put 

--- Page 63 ---
57 
in place where a simpler database could work. When a blockchain-based system is 
deployed unnecessarily, beneficiaries might be required to provide sensitive data about 
themselves, such as biometrics, to an immutable register, in order to access temporary 
aid, which this study has argued could lead to a loss of dignity. Furthermore, the 
unnecessary deployment of such a system means that the humanitarian organization will 
likely have to implement a technical solution over which it lacks the expertise, making it 
dependent on third-party actors.  
5.6.2 Consider the context in which the program is to be implemented 
The implementation of any technology is influenced by the social context in which it 
takes place (Lee, 2020), and the specificities of each context should be considered by 
humanitarian organizations (Zwitter & Boisse-Despiaux, 2018). This aspect was not 
often discussed in Cases A and B – likely because contextual considerations are made 
during the design phase, and the secondary data sources reviewed tended to focus on 
what occurred after the program had been implemented. Nevertheless, interviewees 
from Case C have emphasized the idea that the use of blockchain may be more suitable 
to certain environments than others. Interviewee 1 has stated that:  
Because not only because it's a highly technological – or because it's highly technological? – it will 
or will not work in a given context. There are many different factors and variables that would make 
this an appropriate sort of means of, as a humanitarian assistance distribution. (Interviewee 1)  
Context, in this case, refers to multiple aspects, including the country of implementation. 
As explained by Interviewee 2, Kenya was deemed as a suitable place for the Feasibility 
Study conducted in Case C due to various factors, including the country’s political 
stability and the population’s habit of using mobile payment systems. Conditions such 
as these will not be present in all countries, as explained by Interviewee 1: 
Of course, it was decided that it was a feasible context on which to test, at least to pilot the program, 
so it was in Kenya, given, you know, the context where people have the necessary tools, they also 
have highly working markets, and also many displaced people or refugees. So, in this case, it was 
a good, sort of it met all the requirements for it to be fertile for piloting a project. That would sort 
of limit the number of obstacles. Because, I mean, if we try that in Syria, I can tell you that, you 
know, day two and it wouldn't probably be very feasible. (Interviewee 1) 
The analysis of the legislative landscape of the country in question is also part of a 
contextual assessment. Case B, for example, has been criticized by Jutel as a “blithe 
disregard of the [Vanuatu’s] Reserve Bank’s policy” and an attempt to bypass the host 
country’s legal framework (2022, p. 6). Interviewee 1 has confirmed, in Case C, the need 
to gain approval from local governments before implementing a program, stating that: 

--- Page 64 ---
58 
You always need to have permission for running a sort of a program, especially when there is cash 
or some technologies that might be, you know, in some in some regions, it might be controversial, 
like in Colombia, there was, it was not allowed to take any biometrical data. That was a 
governmental guideline. We could not do that. So in this case it wouldn't work. So anyway, in this 
way you are understanding what the context is and what the challenges might be. (Interviewee 1)  
As explained by Interviewee 2, In order to ensure that the Finnish team had a good 
understanding of the Kenya context for the Feasibility Study of Case C, weekly meetings 
with FCA’s Kenyan team were held for at least two months prior to a visit to the country 
in question. Once there, the project’s Lead Designer and Ethnographer, alongside a local 
guide, met with community leaders and ran focus groups with beneficiaries in order to 
understand the particular opportunities and challenges present.  
A humanitarian organization should make similar investigations regarding the context 
where a program is to be implemented. That can be done as part of the analysis and 
program design phase of the CVA Project Cycle, in which the appropriateness of a 
potential response is measured against its surroundings (Shrestha & Smart, 2022). In it, 
beyond the above-mentioned considerations, it can also investigate how the program 
would affect local actors – i.e. whether their participation in the humanitarian supply 
chain would be reduced in a detrimental way, as was defined as a potential risk in this 
study.  
5.6.3 Consider the infrastructure and other technologies required to 
implement a blockchain-based program 
Context also refers to being aware of other technologies that might be needed in order 
for the system to work. As pointed out by Sahebi, Masoomi, and Ghorani (2020), 
integrating blockchain with other systems requires time and resources, as well as high 
energy consumption. Oftentimes, other technologies need to be implemented in order 
for a blockchain-based program to work, such as the devices to scan beneficiaries’ 
biometrics in Case A (Awan & Nunhuck, 2020), or the smartphones capable of reading 
NFC cards in Case B (Document B2). Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2020) go even further, 
showing how the combination of blockchain with other advanced technologies such as 
artificial intelligence and 3D printing can be used to improve operations in humanitarian 
supply chains. That point was emphasized in Case C by Interviewee 4: 
Often it happens that blockchain is used not alone, really. Many times you use these IoT systems, 
and then of course, in some cases you use some machine learning and AI related stuff, and then 
together they give you the solution. It's not just one thing. It's not just blockchain. Blockchain is 
just a database that ensures transparency and trust, nothing else. But then you’ll need the IoT 
devices from where you get the data, and then those data will be stored. (…) That's why I'm telling 
this, that, you know, don't, never, you know, jump to the solution of blockchain at the very 
beginning. You really need to understand the context, you really need to understand the current 

--- Page 65 ---
59 
situation. You also need to understand the investments because this is a whole new system. 
(Interviewee 4) 
After the required infrastructure and accompanying technologies are identified and their 
availability is confirmed, beneficiaries and other partners have to be trained on how to 
use the system. In the case of retailers, for example, Interviewee 1 has explained that: 
(…) because of course, they have to have the right terminal or the right equipment to read the 
biometrics or whatnot. So we would do a training course for them, we would troubleshoot 
anything. We would sort of, you know, spend a good time for them to be able to receive the 
payments and to feel comfortable as to how this system works. (Interviewee 1) 
A similar need for training was reported in Cases A (Document A2) and B (Document 
B2), and humanitarian organizations looking to implement blockchain-based systems 
should be aware of the fact that it will likely represent a steep learning curve for most, if 
not all, stakeholders involved in the project.  
5.6.4 Involve beneficiaries in the design process 
The power imbalance between humanitarian organizations and beneficiaries can be 
exacerbated when the latter are not included in the design of a program (Coppi & Fast, 
2019), which may revert CVA’s and blockchain’s general empowering potential discussed 
in Chapter 2. Even worse, implementations that do not take into account the beneficiary 
perspective could lead to vulnerable people and economies, particularly in the context of 
refugee camps (Madianou, 2019), becoming “testing grounds for technologies” (Jutel, 
2022, p. 2). Cases in which digital innovation contributes to the reproduction of existing 
power asymmetries are referred to as technocolonialism (Madianou, 2021). As 
summarized by Coppi and Fast: 
The adoption of DLT therefore tends to reflect the needs and perspectives of those using the 
technology rather than the needs of those affected by it. This mirrors a frequent critique of the use 
of new technologies in the sector – that they are more often a technology in search of a problem 
than a solution to a perceived problem. (Coppi & Fast, 2019, p. 15) 
In order to avoid this, beneficiaries should be involved in the design process, with their 
preferences being taken into account – both in terms of what they would and would not 
be comfortable using. Document A1 brings an example of this, highlighting how some of 
the women participating in Case A had health concerns associated with biometric 
scanning devices: 
Women workers expressed a range of fears and perceptions about the bodily effects of regular iris 
scanning: from “We will go blind from the amount of eye scans we do,” to “I fear for my eyes and 
my health,” to “It’s all the time for the salary and the food and every time we want to buy bread 
too. My eyes burn after I scan them, it’s too much.” Some people worried about the effects of iris 
scans on pregnant women, or on reproductive organs more generally. (Document A1) 

--- Page 66 ---
60 
Beneficiaries’ concerns should not be underestimated, and the possibility to opt out of 
the collection and processing of personal data should be given to them, without their 
receiving of aid being affected (Burton, 2020). Any system that intends to help people 
and reduce potential harm should involve the beneficiaries it is meant to serve and take 
into account their preferences and limitations. If, for instance, a digital payment scheme 
cannot be used, the humanitarian organization responsible should be able to offer 
alternatives, including in-kind assistance or cash (Burton, 2020). Interviewee 3 has 
shared some of his experience with these considerations: 
There are, often times, people may prefer like having cash over card, but then there's also often 
times situations where you have, say, the local culture isn't accustomed to using cash. So I 
remember like, for example in South Sudan, we did, or our team did, I wasn't there, but our team 
did a cash intervention and then they followed up a couple of weeks later. Unfortunately, there was 
this one lady there that just like, dug a hole. Like, on the floor of her hut and just hid the money 
over there because she didn't really, like sort of like, know what she was supposed to be doing with 
this stuff, and she was waiting for her husband to come back so that they could sort of make a 
decision on what to do with this. (Interviewee 3) 
Involving beneficiaries in the design process is encouraged by Coppi and Fast (2019), 
and can lead to positive results. Sheppard et al. (2013), for example, have argued that 
involving local populations can contribute to preparedness and response in natural 
disasters, making humanitarian supply chains more effective, while Kovács et al. (2010) 
have shown how community involvement in the reconstruction phase can lead to more 
transparency and cost efficiency, as well as positive effects to the local economy. A 
humanitarian organization that encourages beneficiary participation can, furthermore, 
address ethical concerns and risks that cannot otherwise be resolved, such as loss of 
dignity. 
5.6.5 Consider whether particular groups of beneficiaries would be left 
behind 
Even when the required infrastructure exists for the functioning of a blockchain-based 
system, such as electricity, smartphones, and internet access are required, access to it is 
not always a given, especially for segments of the population that are already 
marginalized. Women and girls, for instance, tend to have less access to smartphones – 
as well as less access to identification documents and financial systems (Thylin & Duarte, 
2019). Their vulnerability could be further increased because of these restrictions in 
access (Seyedsayamdost & Vanderwal, 2020), in direct violation of the humanitarian 
principle of impartiality, according to which these people’s needs should be prioritized 
(Baharmand et al., 2021b). 

--- Page 67 ---
61 
All three cases analyzed in this study have taken these considerations into account and 
can be seen as examples of best practices. In Case A, the implementation done by UN 
Women in Jordan has explicitly attempted to address women’s generally lower level of 
digital literacy and access to technology (Document A2). In Case B, Oxfam emphasized 
the inclusion of a particularly vulnerable group of beneficiaries, which included “single 
mothers, widows, people with a disability, and LGBTIQ+ members”, in the UnBlocked 
Cash program, considering that they would be at a higher risk of marginalization after a 
natural disaster (Document B1, p. 21). Finally, in Case C, Interviewee 1 has pointed out 
the need to identify: 
Who would benefit? Would there be some kind of group that wouldn't? Perhaps the elderly who 
do not do well with technology, or the illiterate or whatnot. So this is, you know, standard 
procedures when you implement anything basically. So we would cover the obstacles that we may 
face, and then we can seek thereafter to find ways to mitigate it. So we create a risk matrix and 
then we sort of assess how likely is it and if it is, how harmful is it? So maybe there's little chance 
that it happens, but if it does happen, then it's a big problem. (Interviewee 1)  
The involvement of beneficiaries in the design project, which was suggested in the 
previous section, can facilitate the identification by organizations of how different groups 
of participants would respond to a program, as well as how each of them would be 
affected by particular risks (Burton, 2020).  
5.6.6 Choose partners carefully  
As explained in Chapters 2, 4 and in the first part of this Chapter 5, humanitarian 
organizations that lack the technical knowledge required for the implementation of 
blockchain-based solutions are at risk of dependency on partners who are not obligated 
to follow humanitarian rules and principles. Because of that, organizations should seek 
to establish partnerships with reputable and trustworthy partners.  
Another key point is that humanitarian organizations should be aware of the extent to 
which personal data from beneficiaries is shared with partners, as it could enable 
surveillance and other types of misuse. That point was emphasized by Interviewee 1 in 
Case C, who explained that: 
It depends on a lot of things, factors, when throughout the planning and the agreement. For 
example, if this company is going to be our partner to do all the blockchain projects, perhaps in 
that case we are partners and therefore they're part of the project and then... But if they're like, an 
outside contractor company that we sort of hire them for the service alone, we may have other 
plans, we may protect or we may not disclose, or give the information, but again that varies. Also, 
each organization has their own sort of policies on data protection, so it might be that you cannot 
share it with an external partner. So, in that case, you might be forced. So there are different ways, 
I think, to go about it, depending on existing policies and context such as hiring a company. 
(Interviewee 1) 

--- Page 68 ---
62 
As previously mentioned, both the organizations responsible for Cases A and B were 
criticized for their choice of technical partners – the World Food Programme due to its 
partnership with Palantir Technologies, and Oxfam for the participation of Consensys in 
the Vanuatu pilot. That type of criticism can potentially be reduced by humanitarian 
organizations that impose stricter ethical requirements for partnerships. 
5.6.7 Implement data protection by default and by design 
In the academic literature reviewed, privacy and data protection are key points of 
concern, as the protection of beneficiaries’ personal data should be seen as “an essential 
part of protecting their life, integrity and dignity” (Burton, 2020, p. 61). Because of that, 
humanitarian organizations must have in place strong data protection principles and 
practices – which, in the case of blockchain, is not a straightforward matter, as the 
technology’s compatibility with data protection regulations such as the European GDPR 
is still disputed (Martin et al., 2022). 
A key way for humanitarian organizations to embed privacy considerations in a program 
is by implementing data protection by default and by design. That means that privacy 
risks should be anticipated and mitigated, and the most privacy-preserving alternative 
should be set as the default option (ICRC, 2020). Organizations can also include a critical 
assessment of the need to use biometrics in the system, as that constitutes sensitive 
personal data, as previously explained.

6 CONCLUSION 
The present study was conducted with two major aims: determining the risk factors for 
beneficiaries that arise from the use of blockchain technology for the delivery of cash and 
voucher assistance, and creating a theoretical framework that can be used by 
humanitarian organizations when deciding whether the potential benefits of that 
implementation are proportional to the emerging risks posed to beneficiaries. To achieve 
them, two research questions were posed:  
RQ 1: What are the main digital risks posed to beneficiaries when blockchain is 
used for the delivery of cash and voucher assistance? 
RQ 2: How can humanitarian organizations mitigate digital harm to 
beneficiaries when using blockchain technology for the delivery of cash and 
voucher assistance programs? 
Regarding the first question, this study has identified a mismatch between academia and 
practitioners over the potential risks that can arise from blockchain-based CVA 
programs. For the former, risks are considered as systemic and include more abstract 
and ethical notions such as loss of dignity and violation of humanitarian principles. For 
the latter, however, risks arise in exceptional situations, such as in cases of technology 
malfunction.  
In total, 12 risks to beneficiaries were identified in this thesis, being divided into five 
major categories in the revised theoretical framework (shown in Figure 11) proposed at 
the end of the abductive research process (described in Figure 7). Such a theoretical 
framework presents tentative elements for the definition of digital harm when applied 
to the use of blockchain in cash and voucher assistance programs. The risks and 
categories they are classified into are reproduced in Table 6. The Table also informs 
whether each risk was identified based on the literature review conducted, data collected 
from case studies, or both.

Table 6 Answer to the first research question: risks identified, categories and sources 
Interestingly, the analysis of Cases A, B, and C, has shown how the humanitarian 
organizations responsible for these programs – respectively, the World Food Program, 
Oxfam, and Finn Church Aid –, have taken measures to mitigate many of the risks 
identified. These measures are in line with the answers found to this study’s second 
research question. In this thesis, seven such measures are suggested for humanitarian 
organizations to reduce the digital harm to beneficiaries that can be posed by blockchain-
based CVA. The measures were described in Chapter 5 and summarized in Figure 12, 
which also shows which specific risks each measure is meant to address. In brief, the 
measures suggested were: 
1. Considered whether a blockchain-based system is, in fact, needed; 
2. Consider the context in which the program is to be implemented; 
3. Consider the infrastructure and other technologies required to implement a 
blockchain-based program; 
4. Involve beneficiaries in the design process;

5. Consider whether particular groups of beneficiaries would be left behind; 
6. Choose partners carefully; 
7. Implement data protection by default and by design. 
6.1 
Contributions 
As currently there is no framework for the identification and mitigation of digital harm 
to beneficiaries in the context of the application of blockchain technology to cash and 
voucher assistance programs, the present study addresses a gap in both theory and 
practice.  
A theoretical contribution is made with the answer to the study’s first research question, 
in which twelve risk factors of digital harm to beneficiaries in that context are analyzed 
and classified, with a framework of factors being proposed.  
The answer to the second question provides a managerial contribution by compiling a 
list of seven actionable measures for humanitarian organizations trying to reduce the 
potential digital harm to beneficiaries that can be posed by the use of blockchain in CVA 
programs.   
6.2 Limitations and avenues of future research 
The process of collection of primary data had clear limitations, notably the small sample 
size. The reduced number of interviewees was explained by the fact that most of the 
people associated with the Feasibility Study, from the Finn Church Aid side, are no longer 
working at that organization. In the case of Solita, there were only two people involved 
in the project. Another limitation was the lack of respondents from Kenya, who could 
have potentially provided more insight into that country’s context. All interviewees in 
this study were Finland-based. 
Limitations were also present in the collection of secondary data, as the availability of 
materials varied among the cases. Case A had been extensively covered in both media 
and research, while the main documents available in Case B were two final project 
reports. In Case C, the only public information found were two mentions on Finn Church 
Aid’s and Solita’s websites; access to the Feasibility Study was granted to the author, but 
it was agreed that that document should remain confidential.  
The risks identified and considered in this study are not part of an exhaustive list; as time 
passes, new risks will continue to emerge, and it is simply not possible to predict them

all (Burton, 2020). As such, the consideration of new risks as blockchain technology 
continues to evolve, as well as how humanitarian organizations should react to these 
changes, presents one possible avenue of future research.  
Another possibility is to investigate how digitalization affects the role of beneficiaries in 
humanitarian supply chains, and what the limits of technological experimentation on 
vulnerable populations should be. Technology should not be the focus of humanitarian 
action; instead, beneficiaries and their needs should be at the center of the discussion. 
As summarized by Burton: 
Expecting people in crisis situations to absorb new risk or trust unfamiliar systems is a big ask and 
must not be undertaken unless it is in their best interest and with their agreement. (Burton, 2020) 
Finally, as demonstrated in this study, many risks posed by technology to beneficiaries 
can be mitigated through careful design. Because of that, the role of service design in the 
last mile of humanitarian supply chains is also an interesting additional avenue for future 
research.
