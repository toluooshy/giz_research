Introduction
Bitcoin, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, marked the inception of the ﬁrst peer-to-peer currency [1]. Since
its inception, many other cryptocurrencies have been introduced and have gained signiﬁcant traction. As of the end
of 2022, it is estimated that the number of cryptocurrency owners grew to 425 million worldwide [2]. Although
Nakamoto’s original paper mentioned a "chain of blocks," the term "blockchain" itself did not appear in the 2008 white
paper. Instead, "blockchain" evolved as a loose umbrella term [3] within the cryptocurrency community to describe
a suite of technologies—including decentralized ledgers, linked timestamping, Merkle trees, consensus mechanisms,
and public keys as identities—that underpin Bitcoin. These technologies have been recognized for their potential
to revolutionize various sectors such as manufacturing, construction, healthcare, ﬁnance, insurance, supply chain,
agriculture, academic publishing, energy, resource management, and legal systems [4], overcoming challenges related
to information sharing, traceability, and operational efﬁciency.
Despite the signiﬁcant interest and hype about cryptocurrencies and blockchains, more than 10 years since their incep-
tion, they have still not become everyday technologies for consumers [5]. This technology still faces many technical
challenges, such as scalability, security, privacy, interoperability, and energy consumption, as well as business adop-

tion challenges, social, ethical, environmental, and regulatory controversies. We argue that responsible blockchain
development is the key to overcoming these challenges and achieving mass adoption.
Responsible Blockchain Deﬁnition
In this paper, we deﬁne responsible blockchain as a socio-technical system that
fosters sustainable, transparent, ethical, adaptive, decentralized, and inclusive practices among diverse participants to
promote a dynamic equilibrium of interests for its long-term viability. The participants include human actors such as
developers, users, regulatory entities, and non-human actors such as computer hardware, software, protocols, policies,
and the environment.
This paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and controversies of blockchain technology, iden-
tify the technical challenges such as scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability, and also the business and adop-
tion challenges, and social, economic, ethical, and environmental controversies within current blockchain systems.
The paper will then introduce the STEADI principles (sustainable, transparent, ethical, adaptive, decentralized, and
inclusive) aimed at fostering responsible blockchain development, grounded in Actor-Network Theory. Addition-
ally, this paper presents the Actor-Network Theory-based Responsible Development Methodology (ANT-RDM) for
blockchain technology, incorporating the stages of problematization, interessement, enrollment, and mobilization.

Challenges of Blockchain Technology
This section explores the multifaceted challenges associated with blockchain technology, emphasizing technical barri-
ers such as scalability, security, privacy, interoperability, and energy consumption. In addition to technical challenges,
this section delves into business and adoption hurdles, including high setup and maintenance costs, slow transaction
speeds, regulatory uncertainties, and environmental concerns.
2.1
Technical Challenges
This section outlines the signiﬁcant technical challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of blockchain technology,
including scalability, security, privacy, interoperability, and energy consumption.
2.1.1
Scalability
Scalability poses a signiﬁcant obstacle to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology [6]. As the number of
users and transactions on a blockchain network increases, its capacity to process these transactions efﬁciently without
compromising security begins to diminish. This challenge is difﬁcult to overcome due to the inherent conﬂict among
three key pillars of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and scalability. This conﬂict is often referred to
as the "scalability trilemma" [7].
Efforts to increase blockchain throughput often result in compromises in decentralization through mechanisms such as
increasing block size [8], implementing sharding [9] or consolidating validation power as seen in the Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) consensus mechanism [10]. These approaches can pose security risks by potentially creating powerful nodes
capable of controlling or manipulating the blockchain.
2.1.2
Security
Blockchain, known for its features like immutability and decentralization, plays a crucial role in enhancing the security
of various applications and services. However, the security of blockchain itself often gets overlooked. Blockchain can
be considered a ﬁve-layer architecture, which includes the Hardware/Infrastructure Layer, Data Layer, Network Layer,
Protocol (Consensus) Layer, and Application Layer [11, 12]. Each layer of the blockchain architecture has its own set
of security issues.
Hardware-Level Attacks
focus on the physical devices and components within the blockchain network. These
attacks include Backdoor Trojan attacks, where malicious software is installed on hardware to gain unauthorized
access or control [13]. Additionally, Side-Channel attacks exploit indirect information from a cryptographic system’s
physical implementation. Attackers gather secret information by analyzing operational side effects, such as power
consumption or timing [14].
Data Layer Attacks
speciﬁcally target the data component of blockchain transactions. One example is double
spending, which refers to the situation where the same digital currency (or digital asset) is spent more than once [15].
Another example, the Malleability attack [16], is a variant of the double spending attack, derived from the malleability
2

RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
of signatures [16]. A Hash collision attack involves ﬁnding two different inputs that generate the same hash output. If
successful, it could allow attackers to manipulate transactions or create counterfeit data [17].
Network Attacks
encompass various strategies to disrupt blockchain operations. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
ﬂood the network with excessive data, overwhelming resources and blocking legitimate access [18]. In a Sybil attack,
an attacker uses multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to inﬂuence the network and disrupt consensus mechanisms,
potentially manipulating transaction validation or launching a 51% attack [19]. Eclipse attacks isolate a node from the
network, hindering its ability to receive updates and inﬂuencing its consensus decisions [20]. Lastly, routing attacks
manipulate network protocols to redirect trafﬁc through malicious nodes, enabling data interception or injection [21].
Consensus Attacks
Among various attacks, the 51% attack is particularly critical. In Proof of Work blockchains,
an individual or group gains control of more than 50% of the network’s mining power. This dominance allows them to
manipulate the consensus process, enabling actions such as reversing transactions, double-spending coins, or blocking
legitimate transactions [22]. Proof of Stake introduces an economic disincentive for such attacks. The assumption
is that if a 51% attack succeeds, the value of the cryptocurrency will fall. Since the attacker holds a large amount
of this currency, they would suffer signiﬁcant losses. However, attackers could engage in short selling the attacked
cryptocurrency in another market and proﬁt from the subsequent decrease in value, which follows the chaos and loss
of conﬁdence triggered by the attack [23]. Another attack primarily be found in Proof of Work blockchains is selﬁsh
mining, where miners withhold their blocks from the network until certain conditions are met, thereby gaining an
unfair advantage [24].
Smart Contract Attacks
The re-entrancy attack targets vulnerabilities in smart contracts, enabling attackers to re-
peatedly withdraw funds from a single transaction [25]. The Transaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD) attack exploits
the manipulation of transaction sequences to gain an unfair advantage, particularly in scenarios where the order of
transactions is crucial [26]. Another signiﬁcant threat is the front-running attack, where attackers observe pending
transactions and execute trades before them, taking advantage of anticipated price movements [27].
Application Layer Attacks
Phishing attacks are a prominent threat where cybercriminals use fake emails and web-
sites to masquerade as legitimate entities. The goal is to deceive users into disclosing sensitive information such as
login credentials [28]. Social engineering attacks, another serious concern, exploit human vulnerabilities, manipulat-
ing individuals into divulging conﬁdential information or transferring funds to malicious actors [29]. Furthermore,
exchange hacks pose a signiﬁcant risk to cryptocurrency exchanges by targeting and compromising user accounts,
leading to the theft of funds [30].
2.1.3
Privacy
Blockchain’s transparency and immutability facilitate trust and auditability; however, they also present a paradoxical
challenge for data privacy. Despite the common perception that blockchain transactions are anonymous, they are,
in fact, pseudonymous [31]. Blockchain ledgers record transactions publicly, linking them to unique addresses [32].
Although these addresses do not directly identify individuals, they can be linked to real-world identities through various
means, such as deanonymization attacks [33] and on-chain analysis [34]. Once recorded, transactions and associated
data become permanently etched on the chain, accessible to anyone. This permanence impedes individuals’ right to
rectiﬁcation or erasure [35].
2.1.4
Interoperability
Unlike the seamless ﬂow of information across the internet, different blockchains often operate in isolation, unable
to communicate or exchange data effectively [36]. Simple operations, such as transferring assets across different
platforms, can be very difﬁcult to achieve without trusted custodians like cryptocurrency exchanges, which, on the
other hand, can undermine decentralization [37]. This fragmentation leads to interoperability issues, hindering the
true potential of blockchain technology.
One of the primary reasons for these interoperability issues is the heterogeneity of blockchain platforms [38]. Early
blockchain projects, such as Bitcoin, did not prioritize interoperability in their design [39]. Now, with thousands of
blockchains and cryptocurrencies created, the importance of interoperability is becoming more apparent [40]. Each
platform boasts unique features, consensus mechanisms, and programming languages, yet there is a lack of standard-
ized protocols for cross-chain communication [41]. While solutions like cross-chain bridges exist, they suffer from a
lack of universal adoption [42]. These issues are hindering the growth of a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem.
3

RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
Security and privacy considerations also play a signiﬁcant role in these interoperability challenges [43]. Maintaining
trust and the immutability of data when transferring between platforms is crucial. Securely verifying the authenticity of
data originating from another blockchain requires robust mechanisms that ensure data integrity and prevent malicious
manipulation [44]. Striking the right balance between security and efﬁcient cross-chain communication remains a
complex challenge.
Beyond technical hurdles, the governance models of different block-chains can also create friction [45]. Decentralized
governance and independence are core values of blockchain; however, reaching a consensus on how to integrate and
manage data exchange across platforms with diverse governance structures can be an arduous and time-consuming
process. A case study [46] compares the governance mechanisms of Bitcoin and Dash. Dash utilizes the Decentralized
Governance By Blockchain (DGB) process [47], while Bitcoin relies on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)
process [48]. This difference in models signiﬁcantly impacted their decision-making speed. Dash could decide on
altering the block size in just a few hours, whereas Bitcoin’s governance took several years to reach the same decision.
2.1.5
Energy Consumption
The energy consumption associated with blockchain and cryptocurrency operations is signiﬁcant. Globally, the energy
usage of blockchain technology is estimated to exceed 100 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually [49]. To contextualize
this, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that, in 2021, the average American household con-
sumed approximately 10,632 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year [50]. Thus, the energy used by blockchain
technologies is sufﬁcient to power an estimated 9.4 million U.S. households.
The energy consumption problem is particularly pronounced in blockchain systems that utilize the Proof of Work
(PoW) consensus mechanism [51] such as Bitcoin. There are three main sources of energy consumption in blockchain
operations: data storage, the computation required for PoW, and communication between nodes. An economic thresh-
old analysis [49] reveals that for a typical PoW blockchain consuming 100 TWh annually, data storage accounts for
50 MWh to 4.25 GWh, which is only 0.00005% to 0.00425% of the total consumption. Communication between
nodes uses about 88 MWh (0.000088%), while a staggering 99.99% of energy is consumed by the mining process.
his process is particularly energy-intensive because it requires network participants (miners) to competitively solve
complex cryptographic mathematical puzzles, demanding substantial computational power [52].
The energy consumption is crucial to the security and reliability of the Bitcoin network [53]. However, the sustainabil-
ity of such high energy usage, particularly from non-renewable sources, becomes increasingly questionable as these
blockchains expand. This concern has spurred the exploration of alternative consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of
Stake (PoS). A signiﬁcant transition occurred when Ethereum completed its "Merge" on September 15, 2022, moving
from Proof of Work (PoW) to PoS. According to the Ethereum [54], this shift could reduce its energy consumption by
approximately 99.95%.
2.2
Business and Adoption Challenges
In addition to the technical challenges discussed, widespread business adoption also faces hurdles. These include
signiﬁcant setup and maintenance costs, along with the necessity for regular updates [55]. Additionally, the regulatory
landscape for digital assets remains unclear, with differing views including money, property, commodity, and security
[56] to issue initial coin offerings (ICOs) [57], complicating their integration with existing ﬁnancial systems [58].
To address these challenges requires a joint effort [59]. The Blockchain Innovation Adoption Framework reveals that
both organizational and individual factors are crucial [60]. For small and medium businesses, management support,
affordability, and regulatory guidance are key to leveraging blockchain [61]. The adoption of blockchain is inﬂuenced
by various factors. In supply chains, its beneﬁts and external pressures play a signiﬁcant role [62]. Readiness and
top management support are essential for successful implementation, as evidenced by research in Ireland [63]. While
blockchain can offer transparency for consumers, the associated costs may deter manufacturers [64]. Blockchain’s
adoption can also impact the gray market, inﬂuencing manufacturers’ pricing strategies and gray marketers’ entry
based on additional costs and product quality in foreign markets [65]. The strategic risks of adopting blockchain
encompass business, legal, and technological considerations [66]. Initial blockchain implementation in companies is
shaped by the novelty of the technology, associated costs, and external scrutiny [67].

Controversies Surrounding Blockchain Technology
Despite the potential of blockchain to transform society by introducing transparency, trust, and immutability, it is
not without its detractors and dilemmas. This section analyzes the controversies surrounding blockchain technology,
including the social, ethical, environmental, and regulatory controversies it faces. From the digital divide to privacy
4

--- Page 5 ---
RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
concerns, and illicit activities, this section highlights the need for responsible approaches in blockchain development
and governance.
3.1
Social and Ethical Controversies
Blockchain, despite its potential for revolutionizing various industries, also faces a critical hurdle: the digital divide.
The problem of the digital divide arises primarily from the uneven distribution and application of this technology
across different nations and societies [68]. Disruptive technologies like blockchain can impact growth, employment,
and inequality by creating new markets and business practices and necessitating new product infrastructures and work
skills. However, not all societies and economies are equally positioned to adopt these technologies. This reality
contributes to the broadening of the digital divide, not just between developed and underdeveloped nations [69] but
also between rural and urban populations [70], and between genders [71].
Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are known for their immutability and transparency. Each transaction is perma-
nently recorded on an immutable ledger, which is openly accessible. However, this openness can infringe upon user
privacy and may conﬂict with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation [72]. This regulation, effective since
May 2018 [73], includes provisions such as the "right to erasure" or "right to be forgotten" (RtbF), creating signif-
icant concerns for users of public blockchain systems.
To align blockchain’s immutability with legal requirements such as the Right to be Forgotten (RtbF), the concept
of a redactable blockchain has been introduced. For instance, a speciﬁc model known as the k-time modiﬁable and
epoch-based redactable blockchain (KERB) allows participants to modify content [74]. This model imposes monetary
penalties to deter and penalize malicious actions. However, the implementation of such mutable blockchain systems
contradicts the original principles of blockchain technology, presenting challenges in maintaining integrity and trust
within the blockchain ecosystem. [75] suggest using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol to enable the
original content provider, or their delegates, to issue an erasure request across all IPFS nodes. Nevertheless, they also
recognize that fully enforcing content erasure in a decentralized network like IPFS is a challenging task.
3.2
Environmental Impact
The environmental impact of blockchain technology is a pivotal topic of debate. On one hand, critics point to envi-
ronmental degradation associated with the energy-intensive proof-of-work mining process, which not only increases
CO2 emissions but also leads to the rapid obsolescence of mining equipment, and signiﬁcant e-waste [76]. Research
[77, 78, 79] has identiﬁed empirical evidence of a causal link between cryptocurrency activity and environmental
degradation, suggesting both bidirectional [77] and unidirectional [80, 81] relationships between them. These ﬁnd-
ings highlight the urgent need for the industry to adopt green technologies and implement ﬁscal reforms to reduce its
ecological footprint, as advocated by [77].
On the other hand, blockchain offers promising solutions for environmental sustainability. It improves sustainability
across various sectors by enhancing traceability and transparency, notably through smart contracts [82]. Blockchain
disrupts traditional industries, aiding them in achieving the UN’s sustainable development goals [83]. Additionally, it
supports circular economy strategies—such as facilitating markets for second-hand goods— which may signiﬁcantly
reduce environmental impacts by changing the way materials and natural resources are valued and traded [84]. It
potentially cuts environmental footprints by up to 53.8% in these applications [85].
3.3
Potential for Illicit Activities
The anonymity provided by blockchain technology, particularly in the case of Bitcoin, presents a double-edged sword.
While it offers privacy for users, it simultaneously opens avenues for illicit activities [86]. The Bitcoin Blockchain,
with its distributed and openly accessible ledger, conceals the real-world identities of entities behind pseudonyms,
known as addresses. This inherent anonymity in Bitcoin is widely believed to contribute to its utilization in illegal
transactions [87], offering a high level of privacy to its users. Still, Supervised Machine Learning may predict, with
an average cross-validation accuracy of 80.42%, the characteristics of entities that have not yet been identiﬁed [88].
Techniques such as heuristics and graph analysis have proven effective in unraveling the behaviors of Bitcoin addresses
and transactions. These methods enable the identiﬁcation of potential red ﬂag indicators and the analysis of patterns
and typologies associated with illicit behavior [89]. The role of crypto asset mixers, like Tornado Cash, highlights
the need for a balanced approach, allowing ﬁnancial market regulators to address illegal activities while enabling
honest users to engage with privacy-enhancing protocols [90, 91]. The lack of a universally accepted digital forensic
framework for investigating related crimes underscores the challenges faced by law enforcement and regulatory bodies
in adapting to the nuances of cryptocurrency-related investigations, complicating the task of maintaining legal and
5

ﬁnancial order in the digital currency space [92]. The misconception of absolute anonymity was further clariﬁed by
the case of Coinbase v. U.S. [93]. The court’s decision, in this case, authorized the IRS to acquire user data from
Coinbase with deﬁned limitations. As highlighted by [94], the Coinbase case shows that even with strict theoretical
regulations, practical solutions prevail when monitoring millions of transactions to apply the law and preserve users’
privacy. The needed balance of anonymity, trust, and the ability to audit to ensure the prevention of illicit activities
conducted via cryptocurrencies is still an area of research and policy exploration [95].
3.4
Centralization and Governance Issues
Proof of stake (PoS), and other algorithms offer faster validation times and reduced energy consumption [10]. However,
they also present a concern: those with more stake hold more power in the validation process. This raises issues
about censorship and manipulation of the network by large token holders [10]. It creates barriers to entry for smaller
participants, deviating from the initial idealism of blockchain being a grassroots movement [96].
Blockchain governance models encompass critical elements like access rights, decision-making power, incentive struc-
tures, accountability mechanisms, and conﬂict resolution schemes [97]. Underpinning this dynamic governance is a
large number of consensus mechanisms, each crafted for speciﬁc contexts [98]. There are 130 consensus mechanisms
[98], and the number is growing, across various blockchain platforms, with applications in multiple domains, includ-
ing improved supply chain management [99], building trust, and improving efﬁciency with platforms like Blocktivity
[100]. They facilitate improved healthcare management with solutions like BurstIQ [101] and empower decentral-
ized applications through Hyperledger [102]. Different implementation techniques, such as Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG)-based approaches, allow for greater agility in Internet of Things applications [103]. Furthermore, they enable
streamlined real estate transactions [104] and reduce the cost of international payments [105], while being cautious
of causing harm [106]. Establishing robust regulations for digital assets is vital to ensure market stability and protect
consumers and investors [107].

Responsible Blockchain Development Methodology and Principles
The ﬁeld of blockchain development is enriched by a variety of methodologies and design principles, as suggested by
both the research community [108, 109] and industry experts [110]. However, the predominant focus of these frame-
works is on the technical aspects of blockchain technology. This perspective, while crucial, overlooks a fundamental
aspect of blockchain: it is not merely an IT artifact characterized solely by its technical features. Rather, blockchain
represents a complex social network and ecosystem, intricately woven into society [111]. It operates within an en-
vironment that encompasses both human and non-human actors, each contributing to and being inﬂuenced by the
blockchain.
Recognizing this broader context, this paper endeavors to develop an Actor-Network Theory-based Responsible De-
velopment Methodology (ANT-RDM) and establish a set of design principles for blockchain development that extend
beyond technical considerations. These principles aim to address the ethical and social responsibilities inherent in
the creation of blockchain technology, particularly concerning the diverse actors involved in and affected by this envi-
ronment. By integrating these considerations, the proposed design principles seek to foster a more holistic approach
to blockchain development, one that acknowledges and respects the multifaceted nature of the technology and its
far-reaching implications in society.
Actor-Network Theory (ANT) serves as the primary theoretical lens guiding our methodology and principles. ANT is
a theoretical and methodological approach used in social science, particularly in the ﬁelds of science and technology
studies, organizational studies, and sociology [112]. The origins of ANT can be traced back to science and technology
studies in the 1970s [113]. It was inﬂuenced by grounded theory and semiotics, as demonstrated in the ethnographic
work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar at the Salk Institute [113].
Actor-network theory views the world as a web of interconnected relationships, where everything from people and
ideas to technologies and objects plays an active role in creating the outcomes we observe. ANT enables the study of
assembling and stabilizing diverse human and non-human entities within diffuse socio-material systems [114], such
as blockchains.
Actor-network theory (ANT) offers valuable insights for analyzing blockchain systems. This paper leverages the
following key propositions of ANT.
Heterogeneous Networks: ANT posits that the social, technical, natural, and conceptual elements of the world are
interconnected in heterogeneous networks [112]. These entities are called actants, which can be both human
6

--- Page 7 ---
RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
and non-human, such as organizations, animals, technological artifacts, and concepts. Networks can be messy
and inconsistent, containing contradictions and conﬂicts. There is no single, true representation of reality.
Generalized Symmetry: There is no distinction between "human" and "non-human" actors. Non-human actors also
have their own interests. Both inﬂuence the network equally. This includes entities like animals, technologies,
texts, and even natural phenomena [115]. This approach avoids privileging certain types of entities over others
in explaining social phenomena.
Evolution: Reality is never ﬁxed but is always under construction [114]. ANT focuses on how networks are con-
structed and how actors (entities within the network) assume roles and gain inﬂuence. It helps us understand
how networks emerge, stabilize, or change over time [116]. According to ANT, maintaining a network re-
quires ongoing, repeated interactions and alignment of interests between actors; otherwise, it leads to the
network’s dissolution.
ANT provides an excellent theoretical lens for responsible blockchain development.
Network-Centric View: At its core, blockchain is a network of interconnected nodes storing and validating data
[117]. This aligns perfectly with the network-centric perspective of ANT, where actors (both human and non-
human) negotiate and translate meanings to establish temporary social orders. ANT suggests that one design
goal of the blockchain is to keep the network stable, ensuring that actors remain enrolled in the network
without it collapsing.
Stakeholder Inclusivity: The "Generalized Symmetry" principle of ANT dismantles the human-centricview [118] by
recognizing all elements within the blockchain network as "actors," whether they are developers, users, min-
ers, code, smart contracts, or even the underlying computational infrastructure. This holistic view is crucial
for responsible development, as neglecting non-human actors can lead to unforeseen environmental, social,
and economic consequences. Responsible development translates this principle into inclusive governance
models, ensuring diverse voices are heard and addressed.
Heterogeneity and Interdependence: ANT emphasizes the heterogeneity of actors, acknowledging their diverse in-
terests, values, and capabilities. Responsible development requires understanding these varied perspectives
and fostering interdependence, ensuring no single actor dominates the network and decisions prioritize col-
lective well-being.
Dynamics of Alignment: ANT highlights the dynamic nature of blockchain networks, where actors constantly nego-
tiate and align their interests to maintain network stability [112]. ANT encourages ﬂexible and adaptive gov-
ernance mechanisms. Responsible development translates this principle into open and transparent processes
for deliberation, ensuring ongoing alignment with evolving ethical, social, and environmental considerations.
Methodology: Beyond an abstract understanding, ANT is also a methodology [114]. Its methodological tools equip
developers with practical frameworks for mapping the intricate relationships within the network, identifying
potential power imbalances, and assessing the ethical implications of design choices.
4.1
Responsible Blockchain Design Principles
Actor Network Theory (ANT) provides a comprehensive approach to responsible blockchain design by emphasizing
a network-centric perspective, stakeholder inclusivity, and the importance of maintaining a dynamic balance among
diverse actors. ANT encourages the recognition of both human and non-human elements within the blockchain as
critical stakeholders, promoting designs that prioritize network stability, inclusive governance, and the integration of
varied interests and values. We identify the following ANT principles to be particularly helpful for the responsible
development of blockchain.
• Sustainable
• Transparent
• Ethical
• Adaptive
• Decentralized
• Inclusive
We call these principles the STEADI principles. We elaborate on each of the principles below.
7

--- Page 8 ---
RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
Sustainable:
Sustainability in the context of responsible blockchain encompasses various dimensions, including
environmental [119], economic, and social sustainability [120]. Environmental sustainability involves reducing the
energy consumption and generation of electronic waste associated with blockchain operations [121]. Efforts may
include adopting energy-efﬁcient consensus mechanisms, harnessing renewables, and using efﬁcient hardware. Eco-
nomic sustainability is about creating a sustainable economic framework for the blockchain that supports its ongoing
functionality and motivates involvement. Social sustainability aims to foster equal opportunities for access and en-
gagement within the blockchain community [120].
Transparent:
Transparency refers to the characteristic of blockchain systems that ensures the visibility and acces-
sibility of information to all participants involved, without compromising privacy or security. This transparency can
be achieved through various means such as openness, auditability, traceability, and explainability. Openness [122]
makes the blockchain’s rules, governance, and data readily accessible to all participants. This fosters trust and allows
for community scrutiny and participation. Auditability refers to the ability to trace and verify transactions on the
blockchain easily. Every transaction is recorded in a way that is immutable and time-stamped, enabling a clear and ac-
cessible audit trail for all participants. Traceability offers a means to securely record, store, and verify the authenticity
of information across a blockchain [123]. This enables accountability and helps prevent fraud and misuse.
Ethical:
"Ethical" refers to the principles and practices that ensure the blockchain is developed and used in a manner
that is fair, responsible, and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders involved. There are several key aspects of
ethical blockchain development: fairness, accountability, privacy, and alignment of interests. Fairness in blockchain
design offers equal opportunities for participation without favoritism or bias. It includes measures to resist manipula-
tion, ensuring that the blockchain operates in a manner that is just and equitable for all users [124]. Accountability
involves establishing clear mechanisms for holding actors accountable for their actions on the blockchain, which may
include dispute resolution protocols and enforcement mechanisms [125]. Privacy concerns require balancing trans-
parency with individual privacy needs, potentially through anonymization techniques, selective data disclosure, and
robust data security measures [126]. Moreover, ethical blockchain initiatives aim to align the interests of all stakehold-
ers, including users, developers, and the broader society, to foster a harmonious and equitable environment.
Adaptive:
"Adaptive" refers to the ability of blockchain systems or architectures to evolve and adjust in response
to changing requirements, technologies, or environments. ANT emphasizes the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of
networks. Networks constantly break down and regenerate. Actors constantly negotiate their roles and align their
interests. Adaptability can be achieved through adaptive IT artifacts [127] and adaptive governance [126].
Decentralized:
Decentralization is a core principle that underpins the operation and management of blockchain
technology. Decentralization not only refers to the decentralized IT architecture but also to the distributed governance
in which power and decision-making are distributed among participants rather than concentrated in the hands of a
few. This can be achieved through voting mechanisms [128], consensus algorithms, and open collaboration structures
[127].
Inclusive:
"Inclusive" means that the blockchain ecosystem is open, accessible, and diverse for both human and non-
human actors. "Open" signiﬁes open participation [129]. Anyone and any IT artifact should be able to participate in
the blockchain ecosystem without needing permission or gatekeepers. This promotes diversity, innovation, and avoids
single points of failure. "Accessible" implies that the blockchain and its applications are user-friendly and accessible to
people from diverse backgrounds and technical abilities. This entails simple interfaces, clear instructions, multilingual
support, and the ability for people with disabilities to use them effectively and independently [130]. It also means
the blockchain is accessible to hardware and software from different ecosystems. Diversity promotes inclusivity and
participation from underrepresented human actors or non-human actors within the blockchain ecosystem, addressing
gender inequalities, economic inequalities, and geographical disparities [131], and imbalances between alternative IT
architectures.
4.2
Responsible Blockchain Development Methodology
In this section, we introduce the Actor-Network Theory-based Responsible Development Methodology (ANT-RDM).
The development of blockchain refers not only to the development of hardware and software but also to the design
of the network topology, consensus mechanisms, governance structures, policies, etc. Based on ANT, a blockchain
is a network of interconnected actors. The development of blockchains is a process of ’creating a temporary social
order, or moving from one order to another, through changes in the alignment of interests within a network’ [132].
In ANT, this process is referred to as translation [112]. Translation comprises four main stages: problematisation,
interessement, enrolment, and mobilisation [132].

4.2.1
Problematisation
The problematisation stage sets the foundation for the entire translation process. It is where you deﬁne the issue, frame
it in a compelling way, and gather the key actors needed to address it. Here are four key actions to focus on during this
stage:
Deﬁne the problem
Clearly identify the speciﬁc issue or challenge that blockchain technology could potentially
address. Pinpoint the core pain point and its underlying causes. The problems may be external, such as a lack of trust
and societal inefﬁciencies, or internal to the blockchain itself, including issues like scalability, security, and energy
consumption.
Identify "focal actors"
A focal actor is an entity within a network that holds signiﬁcant inﬂuence over other actors
and the overall network dynamics [112]. They actively shape the network through their actions. They drive the process
of translation and gather other actors’ support.
The focal actors can be identiﬁed by the following factors:
1. Resources: Focal actors control valuable resources like funding, information, or expertise, which give them leverage
over others in the network. Think of them as the ones powering the engine of the project. For example, a company
providing crucial tech infrastructure or a venture capitalist with substantial funding would be resource-rich focal actors.
2. Knowledge: A deep understanding of blockchain technology, speciﬁc market niches, or the project’s technical com-
plexities makes certain actors critical problem-solvers and decision-makers. Their expertise becomes indispensable
for the project’s progress. Imagine a team of seasoned blockchain developers or a regulatory expert guiding the way
through legal hurdles – these are knowledge-rich focal actors.
3. Relationships: Strong connections and alliances with other key players further solidify a focal actor’s position and
amplify their inﬂuence. Think of them as network builders and facilitators. For example, a well-connected industry
consortium or a partnership with a reputable platform can open doors and bring diverse stakeholders together – these
are relationship-rich focal actors. By identifying and engaging with the focal actors, a blockchain project can leverage
their combined resources, knowledge, and network to gain crucial support and funding, navigate complex technical
challenges, build trust and legitimacy within the broader ecosystem, and reach a wider audience and secure user
adoption.

Identify all relevant actors
The goal of responsible blockchain development is to develop blockchain systems that
prioritize ethics, sustainability, and inclusivity. By including a wide range of actors, the development of responsible
blockchains takes into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. This can help to avoid unintended conse-
quences and ensure that blockchain technology is used in a way that beneﬁts everyone. Who are the stakeholders most
affected by the problem? Who else would need to be involved in the network to develop and implement the blockchain
solution? Potential allies and opponents, existing power dynamics, and any potential conﬂicts of interest within the
network should be considered at this step.
From an ANT perspective, blockchain ecosystems are dynamic networks composed of a diverse range of actors, both
human and non-human:
Human Actors may include consumers, who use blockchain-based applications for activities like ﬁnancial transac-
tions, supply chain management, or voting. Miners and validators play a crucial role in creating and verifying new
blocks on the blockchain, often receiving cryptocurrency or fees as rewards. Full nodes, maintained by individuals or
organizations, hold a complete copy of the blockchain ledger, aiding in network security and decentralization. The cat-
egory of software developers encompasses those who develop the software itself, create smart contracts, and develop
blockchain protocols.
Infrastructure providers in the blockchain space include node hosting services, which provide the necessary infras-
tructure to run full nodes and support network operations. Mining pools are collaborations among miners, pooling
computing resources to enhance their chances of ﬁnding blocks and earning rewards. Wallet providers develop both
software and hardware solutions that enable users to store their digital assets and interact with the blockchain. Cryp-
tocurrency exchanges provide the platforms where users can trade cryptocurrencies and blockchain derivatives.
Regulators and policymakers in the blockchain sector involve government agencies that develop and enforce
blockchain-related regulations, inﬂuencing adoption and use cases. Standard-setting organizations deﬁne industry
standards and best practices for blockchain development and implementation. Self-regulatory organizations set volun-
tary guidelines and compliance programs for actors in speciﬁc blockchain ecosystems.
Researchers and academics conduct research on various aspects of blockchain technology, contributing to its future
development and applications. They may include educators, trainers, futurists, and visionaries.
Non-Human Actors may include the Blockchain Protocol, which acts as the foundational technological infrastructure,
enabling interactions and value exchanges. Smart Contracts, as self-executing code on the blockchain, shape interac-
tions and facilitate transactions. Cryptocurrencies and Tokens, as digital assets inherent to the blockchain ecosystem,
function as mediums of exchange and stores of value. Mining Hardware and Infrastructure represent the physical tech-
nology necessary for mining and maintaining the network. Lastly, Software Tools and Applications provide support
for development, wallet management, and interaction with the blockchain system.
Deﬁne the OPP
The focal actor needs to establish an obligatory passage point (OPP), which refers to a situation or
process speciﬁed by the focal actor through which relevant actors can achieve a shared interest [133]. The focal actor
should analyze the current state of the network, existing challenges, and limitations in the context where blockchain is
proposed to be implemented. This relies on the previous step "Deﬁne the problem." Then, the focal actors deﬁne the
OPP and explain why the network needs to pass through the proposed OPP to achieve their interests.
4.2.2
Interessement
Interessement is about ’interesting’ or engaging the actors in the network. At this stage, focal actors convince other
actors to accept the OPP deﬁned in the previous stage. By this stage, the focal actors have identiﬁed all the relevant
actors and have a good understanding of each of their interests. Focal actors should actively involve them in the
project, aligning their interests with the goals of the blockchain. This process often involves negotiation among actors,
and incentives may be provided so that other actors are willing to pass through the OPP [112]. The focal actors can
use demonstrations, prototypes, pilot projects, simulations, or theoretical arguments to convince other actors that the
proposed network will create a "better" social order compared to existing alternatives. During this stage, it’s also
crucial to address any conﬂicts or competing interests among actors. This could involve negotiating terms, modifying
aspects of the blockchain to suit different needs, or even going back to the previous stage and redeﬁning the problems
and OPP.
4.2.3
Enrolment
Enrolment is where the actual development and implementation of the blockchain take place. This step is critical
because it transforms the concept into materialization and acceptance. It is important to note that the development of
10

--- Page 11 ---
RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
responsible blockchains is not the mere creation of IT artifacts; it is the creation of a new social order, a new network
that may stabilize and sustain. They may include:
IT Artifacts:
To develop the hardware, software, IT infrastructure, network architecture, security protocols, and any
other necessary technical elements based on the speciﬁc application and actors’ needs.
Blockchain Governance:
Governance in blockchain refers to the mechanisms, policies, and procedures that de-
termine how decisions are made within a blockchain network. Effective governance is crucial for the sustainability,
adaptability, and trustworthiness of blockchain systems. Issues such as decision-making processes, consensus mech-
anisms, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, representation, fork management, regulatory compliance, smart
contract governance, upgradability, adaptability, economic incentives, and penalties should be considered.
Regulatory Frameworks:
Clear and supportive regulatory guidelines are crucial for the adoption and integration
of blockchain technology. This involves developing laws and regulations that address issues such as private property,
intellectual property, data privacy, security, ﬁnancial transactions, and cross-border legal implications.
Standardization and Interoperability:
Establishing industry standards to ensure interoperability between different
blockchain systems. This includes technical standards for data formats, protocols, and interfaces, as well as operational
standards for governance, auditing, and compliance. Standardization can enhance the scalability and integration of
blockchain systems across various industries.
Protocols:
Developing protocols for blockchains involves creating a set of rules and standards to govern the op-
eration, security, interoperability, scalability, and sustainability of blockchain networks. The protocols may include
consensus protocols, security protocols, scalability protocols, smart contract protocols, governance protocols, and
data storage and management protocols. These protocols are crucial for ensuring the efﬁciency, trustworthiness, and
broader adoption of blockchain technology.
Education and Training:
Developing educational resources and training programs to increase blockchain literacy
among developers, users, and stakeholders is vital. This includes not only technical training but also education about
the legal, ethical, and business aspects of blockchain.
Ethical and Social Frameworks:
Addressing the ethical and social implications of blockchain technology is im-
portant. This includes considering issues of fairness, privacy, digital divide, and the potential societal impacts of
widespread blockchain adoption.
Economic Models:
Creating incentives and reward systems. Developing incentive mechanisms to encourage on-
going participation and contribution is another critical aspect of enrolment. This could involve ﬁnancial incentives,
recognition, or other beneﬁts that motivate actors to remain actively involved in the blockchain network.
Ecosystem Development:
Building a supportive ecosystem around blockchain technology is crucial. This involves
fostering collaborations between startups, established companies, governments, educational institutions, and other
stakeholders. A healthy ecosystem can spur innovation, provide funding opportunities, and facilitate knowledge ex-
change.
In the end of enrolment stage, non-human actors such as the IT artifacts and governance policies are developed, and
their interests are inscribed by their developers [112]. All the human and non-human actors are enrolled and the new
social order and network are adopted.
4.2.4
Mobilisation
Mobilization in blockchain development represents the ﬁnal stage of translation, where a temporary social order solidi-
ﬁes around the block-chain, achieving stability through continuous adoption, usage, and maintenance. This process in-
volves uniting various actors and resources into a stable network dedicated to maintaining and utilizing the blockchain.
Activities may include:
Ensuring Representation of Interests:
In the mobilisation stage, it is crucial that the interests and entities that
have been enrolled in the earlier stages are adequately represented. This means that the blockchain technology and
governance must effectively embody the needs, expectations, and desires of the various actors involved, such as
developers, users, investors, and regulatory bodies.
11

--- Page 12 ---
RESPONSIBLE BLOCKCHAIN - JULY 10, 2024
Facilitate Ongoing Translation and Negotiation:
Continuously adapt the network in response to changing needs
and feedback from actors. Foster ongoing collaboration and participation.
Monitor and Address Power Dynamics:
Be aware of the potential for new inequalities to emerge within the net-
work. Work to maintain a balance of power and prevent any single actor from gaining undue control.
5
Future Research Agenda
Actor-Network Theory-based Responsible Development Methodology (ANT-RDM) is a novel approach to system
development. However, its effectiveness has yet to be fully tested across diverse contexts. There is also a need to
develop supporting tools, metrics, and educational programs to facilitate broader adoption of this methodology.
Empirical Validation
Comparative studies are necessary to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of ANT-RDM
across different settings. This could involve case studies, pilot implementations, controlled experiments, and longitu-
dinal studies comparing ANT-RDM with existing methodologies such as the Waterfall Model [134], Rapid Application
Development (RAD) [135], Agile Development [136], and DevOps [137]. Such research would provide a robust em-
pirical basis for evaluating the methodology’s effectiveness.
Generalization
ANT-RDM and STEADI principles are methodology and principles applicable to any system devel-
opment. This paper discusses these principles within the context of blockchain development; future research could
extend their application to other types of systems, including IT systems (e.g., artiﬁcial intelligence systems), and non-
IT systems (e.g., organizational or social structures). Empirical studies should also test ANT-RDM and its principles
across various cultural contexts.
Performance Metrics
From the ANT-RDM perspective, system performance encompasses more than just the effec-
tiveness and efﬁciency of the IT artifact—it also measures how well the system aligns with and serves the interests
of all stakeholders. Future research should develop metrics to assess this alignment and the perceived mutual ben-
eﬁts among stakeholders. Metrics should be developed to evaluate how well the system adheres to principles like
sustainability, transparency, ethics, adaptability, decentralization, and inclusivity. Both primary methods (e.g., survey
questionnaires) and secondary measures need to be developed to monitor the health of the system effectively.
Tool Development
Computer-aided tools are needed to support each stage of the ANT-RDM process, from prob-
lematization and interessement to enrollment and mobilization. Future developments could include dashboards for
metrics tracking and collaboration tools optimized for the workﬂow of the methodology.
Educational and Training Programs
Future research also needs to develop training programs or educational
courses to help practitioners comprehend and effectively implement ANT-RDM and STEADI principles. Training
could also cover the use of software tools, templates, and best practices speciﬁc to this methodology.

Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and controversies of blockchain technology. It identi-
ﬁes the technical challenges such as scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability, as well as the business, adoption
challenges, and social, economic, ethical, and environmental controversies within current blockchain systems. We
argue that responsible blockchain development is key to overcoming these challenges and achieving mass adoption.
This paper introduces the STEADI principles (sustainable, transparent, ethical, adaptive, decentralized, and inclusive)
for responsible blockchain development. Based on Actor-Network Theory, this paper also introduces the Respon-
sible Blockchain Development Methodology (RBDM), which includes the steps of problematisation, interessement,
enrolment, and mobilisation. This methodology emphasizes the interplay between human actors (developers, users,
regulators) and non-human actors (technology, protocols, code, and environment) and encourages the constant align-
ment of diverse interests within the network to keep the blockchain vibrant and stable.
