Leveraging a multi-theoretical and multi-method approach, this study investigated the factors influencing in­
dividuals’ attitudes and intentions towards adopting central bank digital currency (CBDC). Data from Nigeria, a 
pioneering CBDC nation, were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling, which revealed 
that affordance-based positive valences, including seamless transactions, time convenience, and the societal 
positive valence of financial inclusion, are the strongest predictors of positive attitudes and, subsequently, usage 
intentions. Perceived financial cost emerged as the most significant barrier. Lifestyle compatibility demonstrated 
a moderate positive association with attitude. Further, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis identified four 
necessary conditions for high usage intentions: seamless transactions, trust in the central bank, positive attitude, 
and the societal positive valence of financial inclusion. Additionally, six alternative configurations sufficient for 
high usage intentions were also revealed. These findings offer valuable insights for both theoretical research and 
policymakers, informing strategies to facilitate early CBDC adoption.
1. Introduction
‘Adoption of CBDCs is nowhere close. But about 60 percent of 
countries are exploring them in some form today…Country author­
ities wishing to introduce CBDCs may need to think a little more like 
entrepreneurs. Communication strategies, and incentives for distri­
bution, integration, and adoption, are as important as design con­
siderations.’ Keynote address by Kristalina Georgeiva (Managing 
Director, IMF) in the Singapore Fintech Festival, November 2023.
The potential of blockchain technology to democratise financial 
services, enhance payment system efficiency, and streamline cross- 
border transfers by reducing costs and burdens has prompted central 
banks to consider central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a viable 
solution (Agur et al., 2022; Auer and Bӧhme, 2020; Central Bank of 
Nigeria [CBN], 2021; Ozili, 2023b). CBDC is an electronic form of 
payment issued by a central bank. It represents a digital equivalent of 
physical cash, where the central bank holds the liability (Ozili, 2024; 
Williamson, 2022). As Barrdear and Kumhof (2022) highlighted, CBDCs 
offer universal, electronic, and round-the-clock access to a nation’s 
currency. It is widely acknowledged that numerous countries are 
considering the launch of their CBDCs, thus drawing significant global 
attention (Claessens et al., 2024).
However, the critical question remains: are individuals prepared to 
embrace this digital fiat currency? This inquiry is particularly relevant in 
developing nations such as Nigeria, which launched its own CBDC, the 
eNaira, in late 2021, thus establishing itself as a pioneer in the field 
(Ozili, 2023a). Addressing this question is vital within the emerging 
domain of CBDC research, which has predominantly focused on their 
potential macroeconomic implications and the challenges of policy 
implementation (Agur et al., 2022; Andolfatto, 2021; Auer, 2019; Auer 
and Bӧhme, 2020; Bordo and Levin, 2017; Wang et al., 2022b). Un­
derstanding the readiness of individuals to adopt CBDCs can provide

researchers valuable insights into their broader societal acceptance and 
practical viability. This understanding is crucial to ensure an effective 
transition to CBDCs.
Tronnier et al. (2023) acknowledged the scarcity of research focusing 
on the future users of CBDCs, noting, “Research that focuses on the 
future user of a CBDC is scarce, which is surprising as the success or 
failure of the implementation of a CBDC will ultimately depend on users’ 
attitudes towards a CBDC and their usage of it” (p. 13). This statement 
underscores the need for more research in this area to ensure the suc­
cessful implementation of CBDCs (see Wang et al., 2023). Indeed, a 
similar call for more comprehensive investigations into the factors 
influencing CBDC adoption can be found in the works of Bhaskar et al. 
(2022), Gupta et al. (2023), Kim et al. (2023), and Ogunmola and Das 
(2024).
Notably, an early investigation by S¨oilen and Benhayoun (2022)
identified performance expectations, social influence, facilitating con­
ditions, and trust in the digital currency system as the primary predictors 
of CBDC usage intentions. However, this research largely neglected the 
potential impediments to CBDC adoption, such as perceived risks and 
cognitive effort. However, Gupta et al. (2023) examined both the 
perceived benefits and risks concerning the adoption of India’s digital 
Rupee, determining that the perceived risks may outweigh the perceived 
benefits in adoption decisions (see also Ma et al., 2022). Further, Kim 
et al. (2023) underscored the importance of perceived risks to find that 
performance, financial, and time concerns negatively impacted tourists’ 
willingness to use CBDC for tourism payments.
Despite these insights, a considerable research gap persists due to the 
insufficient exploration of both the drivers promoting and the con­
straints hindering early CBDC adoption. Moreover, most existing studies 
are based on data from countries yet to formally launch CBDCs, which is 
in sharp contrast to the present study’s focus on early CBDC pioneers, 
particularly Nigeria.
Interestingly, Nigeria, despite being a CBDC pioneer with over two 
years of implementation, has seen <2 % of its population actively using 
its eNaira (RegTech Africa, 2023; Ree, 2023), highlighting a significant 
research gap in understanding individual attitudes and intentions to­
wards CBDC within the Nigerian context. Given this discrepancy be­
tween the eNaira’s early adoption and low usage, it is essential to 
investigate the specific factors influencing CBDC uptake in Nigeria. To 
date, no research has directly explored individuals’ attitudes and 
intentions to use CBDC in Nigeria, making this study crucial for under­
standing the specific factors influencing CBDC adoption in Nigeria.
Another limitation of the available literature on CBDC adoption is its 
overreliance on single theoretical frameworks, which may limit our 
comprehension of the intricate decision-making processes that in­
dividuals undergo when considering CBDC adoption. Therefore, this 
study addresses this gap by developing an integrative research model 
that combines the valence framework (Peter and Tarpey Sr, 1975), so­
cial cognitive theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1989, 2005), and the theory of 
reasoned action (TRA) (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein, 1980). By 
combining these theories (see Fig. 1), this study aimed to provide a 
comprehensive picture of the factors influencing CBDC attitudes and 
usage intentions, considering both affordance-based positive valences 
and constraint-based negative valences (valence framework), lifestyle 
compatibility and trust in the central bank (SCT), and subjective norms/ 
attitudes (TRA). The insight gained from this approach would enable 
central banks and media partners to create effective advertising cam­
paigns that encourage initial CBDC acceptance.
Furthermore, recent research has called for integrating traditional 
statistical methods with newer analytical approaches to better under­
stand complex topics such as CBDC adoption (Loh et al., 2023; McLeay 
et al., 2022; Yee et al., 2021). Responding to this call, we adopted a 
multi-method approach that utilised both partial least squares structural 
equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative 
analysis (fsQCA), which allowed us to probe further into the decision- 
making process behind CBDC adoption and, in turn, provide valuable 
insights that can guide policymakers, such as central banks, in pro­
moting early CBDC adoption.
Our study, therefore, represents a novel contribution not only to 
CBDC research but also to the fields of financial technology (fintech) and 
consumer adoption, reflecting a significant methodological advance­
ment in these fields. By combining multiple theories and methods, our 
study unpacks the factors influencing individuals’ attitudes and in­
tentions towards CBDC adoption. Further, conducted in one of the pio­
neering countries of CBDC, i.e., Nigeria, our study is both relevant and 
timely.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 pre­
sents a detailed literature review, the theoretical foundations of the 
study, and hypothesis development. Section 3 outlines our research 
methodology. Section 4 presents the study’s findings based on PLS-SEM

for research and policy, future research directions, and study 
limitations.
2. Literature review
2.1. Financial technology (FinTech)
The rapid innovation of fintech has garnered significant attention 
from scholars, industry practitioners, and policymakers due to its role in 
empowering individuals and society (Chorzempa and Huang, 2022). 
Fintech, as defined by Lagna and Ravishankar (2022), refers to the 
application of technological innovations to support or enable financial 
services. The advantages of fintech include increased transparency, 
improved accessibility to information, reduced costs, and the elimina­
tion of intermediaries (Zavolokina et al., 2016).
For fintech companies to succeed, they must balance the potential 
benefits with perceived costs and risks. This balance is essential, as 
greater perceived benefits and reduced risks can foster positive user 
attitudes and drive fintech adoption (Chan, 2015; Gupta et al., 2023; Pal 
et al., 2021; Ryu, 2018), whereas neglecting risks or failing to deliver 
promised benefits can undermine trust and hinder adoption. In Korea, 
Ryu’s (2018) study on fintech, involving 243 users, found that conve­
nience had the most significant positive impact on the intention to 
continue using fintech, while legal risk had the most detrimental impact. 
Additionally, supply-side factors such as policy reforms and regulatory 
mechanisms play a significant role in mitigating risks associated with 
financial innovation (Auer, 2019; Chorzempa and Huang, 2022).
Meanwhile, the evolution of fintech has also intensified competition 
among banks and fostered collaboration between traditional financial 
service providers and fintech startups (Harasim, 2021). A study by 
Murinde et al. (2022), which spanned 16 years and involved data from 
115 countries, found that fintech lenders are unlikely to replace banks as 
banks are increasingly developing their fintech platforms and collabo­
rating with fintech startups.
Ultimately, the long-term success of fintech depends not only on 
financial institutions or regulators but also on individuals and busi­
nesses. This study, therefore, focused on understanding potential 
adopters by examining their perceptions of CBDC to form a compre­
hensive view of their attitudes and acceptance intentions towards CBDC.
2.2. Central bank digital currency (CBDC)
A CBDC refers to any type of fiat electronic central bank liability used 
as a store of value or for settling payments (Agur et al., 2022; S¨oilen and 
Benhayoun, 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). It falls within the category of 
electronic narrow money (Meaning et al., 2018). While CBDC wallets are 
similar to established fintech platforms such as PayPal, they are also 
fundamentally distinct. Unlike PayPal, which predominantly facilitates 
online payment transactions and lacks legal tender status, CBDC serves 
as a digital representation of fiat currency and possesses legal tender 
recognition.
Previous studies on CBDC have discussed the experiences of “early 
adopters” and how they can benefit the financial sectors (Bordo and 
Levin, 2017). In this respect, Boar and Wehrli (2021) revealed that just 
10 % of surveyed central banks anticipate issuing CBDCs for individuals, 
such as the eNaira in the context of this study.
Researchers have argued that using CBDC provides several potential 
benefits: eliminating expenses associated with physical cash handling, 
such as high storage fees (Gnan and Masciandaro, 2018); promoting 
economic and price stability (Barrdear and Kumhof, 2016); increasing 
public welfare (Williamson, 2022); and reducing reliance on private 
bank funding while facilitating narrow banking (Auer, 2019). Never­
theless, costs associated with using CBDCs remain a contested topic. For 
example, in some countries, the financial sector and banks’ political 
opposition can be attributed to their concerns about the uncertainty of 
the costs and time needed for CBDC adoption, which could be poten­
tially disruptive and slow (Constˆancio, 2017; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 
2022). Such concerns can be mitigated if the interest rate paid for digital 
currency is appropriately chosen by central banks (Keister and Sanches, 
2019) while CBDCs continue to promote lending (Andolfatto, 2021). 
Simultaneously, some scholars have also argued that CBDC utilisation 
could have unintended consequences on financial markets, including the 
volatility of the banking sector and stock markets (cf. Wang et al., 
2022b).
Notably, research on CBDC so far has typically focused on CBDC 
design choices and the potential macroeconomic implications of the 
technology (Agur et al., 2022; Andolfatto, 2021; Auer, 2019; Auer and 
Bӧhme, 2020; Barrdear and Kumhof, 2016; Bordo and Levin, 2017), 
with limited consideration of individuals’ needs and/or perceptions 
concerning the use of CBDCs (see also related commentary by Bhaskar 
et al., 2022; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 2022; Tronnier et al., 2023).
It is well known that individual adoption of technology is central to 
the success of the technology itself; hence, research needs to be geared 
towards understanding the factors influencing voluntary technology 
adoption (Venkatesh et al., 2003), such as in the case of CBDC. As pre­
viously mentioned, previous CBDC studies were more oriented towards 
investigating technological challenges and the currency system archi­
tecture, giving less consideration to factors affecting individual accep­
tance (e.g., Auer and Bӧhme, 2020). As such, there is currently very 
scant understanding of the factors that will either facilitate or under­
mine individuals’ attitudes and their acceptance intentions of CBDCs 
(Bhaskar et al., 2022; Ogunmola and Das, 2024; Tronnier et al., 2023). 
The few existing studies in this area include the research conducted by 
S¨oilen and Benhayoun (2022), who demonstrated that performance 
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions are key for the 
successful individual adoption of CBDCs.
Since CBDCs are still in their nascent stage and only available in a 
few countries to date (S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 2022), individuals may 
base their acceptance of this fintech on a variety of factors, including 
affordance-based positive and constraint-based negative valences 
(Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2011; Pal et al., 2021; 
Palash et al., 2022; Tronnier et al., 2023), as well as factors such as 
lifestyle compatibility (Boateng et al., 2016; Joshi and Chawla, 2023), 
subjective norms (also known as social influence), and trust (Gim´enez 
and Tamaj´on, 2019; Osakwe et al., 2022a; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 
2022). Additionally, recent studies have identified that a major advan­
tage of CBDCs is their potential to expand financial inclusion by offering 
wider access to affordable services for underserved consumers (Bordo 
and Levin, 2017; Ozili, 2023a; Tronnier et al., 2023). Accordingly, CBDC 
has a welfare effect considering that it helps facilitate safe and conve­
nient peer-to-peer payments (Auer and Bӧhme, 2020), which, this study 
posited, will be one of the affordance-based positive valences driving 
initial adoption of CBDC through the development of favourable atti­
tudes (also cf. Tronnier et al., 2023).
Relatedly, a Canadian study by Davoodalhosseini (2021) revealed 
that economic agents prefer to use CBDC over cash when the cost of its 
usage is not perceived as high. This implies that the perceived cost of 
CBDC might also be a constraint-based negative valence that could un­
dermine CBDC adoption through the development of an unfavourable 
attitude towards CBDC use. Similarly, perceived risk as a constraint- 
based negative valence (Pal et al., 2021) has also been argued to un­
dermine individuals’ attitudinal and behavioural predispositions to­
wards CBDC adoption (Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Ma et al., 
2022).
Moreover, beyond positive and negative valences, scholars such as 
S¨oilen and Benhayoun (2022) noted that social recommendations can 
steer CBDC adoption, especially at this early rollout stage, thus high­
lighting the importance of studying the specific role of socio-cognitive 
phenomena such as trust and subjective norms in the early adoption 
of CBDC. All these provide the impetus for these authors to develop an 
integrative research perspective that could assist us in unpacking the 
C.N. Osakwe et al.

numerous perceptions that individuals currently hold about CBDC and, 
subsequently, their use intentions of CBDC.
2.3. Theoretical foundation and hypotheses development
As previously stated, this research drew upon three distinct theo­
retical frameworks and their associated constructs: the valence frame­
work (Peter and Tarpey Sr, 1975), SCT (Bandura, 1989), and TRA (Ajzen 
and Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein, 1980). The utilisation of the valence 
framework within the CBDC context elucidates how individuals assess­
ing a new technology weigh its positive and negative aspects. Thus, 
theories that encompass both positive and negative dimensions in ana­
lysing consumer decision-making align with the objectives of this 
research. Consequently, we employ the valence framework, which is 
rooted in economics and psychology, to explore how consumer decision- 
making in the CBDC context is shaped by potential benefits (or 
affordance-based positive valences) and perceived constraints. Peter and 
Tarpey Sr (1975) explored three consumer decision-making models 
based on the valence framework: the expected net utility model (e.g., 
perceived net return), the expected positive utility model (e.g., 
perceived return/benefit), and the expected negative utility model (e.g., 
perceived risk). They theorised that consumers perceive both positive 
and negative consequences of transactions, aiming to minimise negative 
utility, maximise positive utility, and optimise their overall net utility. 
Thus, the valence framework, which considers both uncertainties and 
perceived benefits as fundamental factors influencing consumer 
behaviour, is superior to models that only examine the positive or 
negative consequences of transactions. By accounting for a wide range of 
benefits and uncertainties, the valence framework offers a more 
comprehensive understanding of how perceptions of positive and 
negative outcomes influence consumer decision-making (Peter and 
Tarpey Sr, 1975). Hence, recognising the need to broaden the scope of 
CBDC adoption research, this study drew upon valence theory to explore 
the understudied role of positive and negative valences in individual 
decision-making towards CBDC. This approach aligns with previous 
research in fintech (Lu et al., 2011; Pal et al., 2021; Palash et al., 2022).
The second theoretical framework utilised in this work is SCT, pro­
posed by Bandura (1989). SCT is highly relevant for studying human 
behaviour as it emphasises the interplay among individual behaviour, 
cognition, and the environment. It highlights the effects of socio- 
environmental and personal cognitive factors such as social influence, 
trust in the central banks, and lifestyle compatibility on behaviour. The 
social cognitive aspect is particularly concerned with how individuals 
perceive themselves and their social world, which, in turn, shapes their 
judgments and decisions (Bandura, 2005).
Specifically, this study adopted SCT due to its relevance in studying 
attitudes towards technology use (Boateng et al., 2016; Kimiagari and 
Baei, 2024; Osakwe et al., 2022b). Besides, SCT has garnered empirical 
support in the wider literature (Demirel, 2022; Lin and Hsu, 2015; Ng 
and Lucianetti, 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2022).
The third theoretical perspective employed in this study is TRA 
(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980). TRA posits that behaviour is driven by in­
tentions, which are influenced by attitudes and shaped by subjective 
norms. This theory has demonstrated significant predictive power in 
various studies (Ng, 2023; Park, 2000; Sheppard et al., 1988) and is 
particularly relevant in the context of technology adoption research 
(Choi et al., 2014; Featherman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a).
Thus, by integrating the valence theory, SCT, and TRA to explore 
individuals’ attitudes and usage intentions towards CBDC, this study 
aimed to identify potential affordance-based positive valences of CBDC 
(e.g., seamless transactions) and constraint-based negative valences 
(perceived risk, financial cost, cognitive effort). Further, it also consid­
ered SCT-related concepts (i.e., trust in the central bank, lifestyle 
compatibility, and subjective norms) in shaping CBDC adoption. This 
study pioneers the integration of these influential theoretical perspec­
tives within fintech research and CBDC investigation, offering a 
comprehensive framework for understanding the factors influencing 
CBDC adoption.
2.3.1. Affordance-based positive valences related to CBDC use
Given that fintech users are primarily seeking positive valences, 
particularly in the form of utilitarian benefits rather than hedonic ad­
vantages (Jain and Raman, 2022; Lu et al., 2011; Ryu, 2018), we 
identified four affordance-based positive valences of CBDC: societal- 
related benefits (i.e., financial inclusion) and individual-related bene­
fits of seamless transactions, perceived superiority, and time conve­
nience, as discussed below.
2.3.1.1. Financial inclusion. Financial inclusion is a societal benefit 
related to the overall availability, accessibility, and ease of use of the 
formal financial system for individuals and households (Lagna and 
Ravishankar, 2022; Sahay et al., 2015). Building on evidence that mo­
bile money enhances financial inclusion by increasing accessibility, 
usage, and affordability of financial services (Bongomin et al., 2018; 
Jahan et al., 2019), we proposed that the potential for CBDC to drive 
similar inclusion might motivate user adoption. Existing research sug­
gests that financial inclusion benefits, such as improved livelihoods, 
economic opportunities, and societal prosperity, can positively influence 
mobile money adoption (Teutio et al., 2023). Similarly, in the Chinese 
context, perceptions of the societal benefits of CBDCs have been found to 
stimulate individuals’ willingness to use the currency (Wang et al., 
2023). Against this backdrop, we hypothesised that in low- and middle- 
income countries such as Nigeria, where financial exclusion is prevalent 
(Sahay et al., 2015), individuals may develop positive attitudes towards 
CBDC adoption due to its potential to expand financial access and reduce 
reliance on high-cost alternatives (Foster et al., 2021; Ozili, 2023a). 
Hence, the following hypothesis can be articulated: 
H1.
The potential societal benefit of CBDC, as encapsulated by finan­
cial inclusion, will be positively associated with individual attitudes 
towards CBDC.
2.3.1.2. Seamless transaction. Seamless transactions, defined as “the 
transaction-related benefit of using Fintech (e.g., buying, money trans­
ferring, lending, and investing)” (Ryu, 2018, p. 547), are increasingly 
prioritised by financial institutions to meet user expectations. In other 
words, seamless transactions connote speedy transactions, such that it is 
expected that the use of CBDC will lead to secure and rapid transactions, 
without the need for a middleman such as a bank agent. While studies 
have suggested that seamlessness alone may not be the strongest moti­
vator for initial adoption, as users often expect such features (Jain and 
Raman, 2022), Ryu (2018) highlighted a strong association between 
seamless transactions and perceived benefits, which, in turn, drive 
adoption intention. Furthering this point, Huang et al. (2023) argued 
that, in the context of virtual currencies, seamless transactions “are 
likely to enhance the user’s positive attitude toward the use of the 
cryptocurrency” (p. 576). This aligned with our focus on exploring the 
link between seamless CBDC transactions and individual attitudes. 
Accordingly, we postulated that individuals perceiving CBDC as offering 
such smooth and effortless experiences would be more likely to develop 
favourable attitudes towards its use. Hence, the following hypothesis 
can be articulated: 
H2.
Seamless CBDC transactions will be positively associated with 
individual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.1.3. Perceived Superiority. Perceived superiority has been defined 
by Xu et al. (2017) as “the degree to which a consumer believes novel 
and superior contents are embodied in the new technology generation 
when compared with previous technology generations” (p. 111). This 
suggests that the perceived superiority of a technology can be charac­
terised by improvements in technological features, capabilities, and

other relative advantages (Rogers, 1995; Xu et al., 2017). Given its 
foundation in blockchain technology, CBDC might be perceived as su­
perior to other alternatives such as paper money, mobile money, PayPal, 
and SMS banking by individuals who may be relatively knowledgeable 
in both established and emerging technologies. This perception could be 
influenced by the central bank’s direct control over CBDC, a stark 
contrast to the volatility of conventional digital currencies like Bitcoin. 
Consequently, these individuals might anticipate greater relative ad­
vantages from CBDC use, leading to positive attitudes towards its 
adoption. Thus, the following hypothesis can be articulated: 
H3.
Perceived superiority of CBDC will be positively associated with 
individual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.1.4. Time convenience. Time convenience, which reflects minimal 
user effort and time spent on financial transactions, has been shown to 
influence the utilitarian value associated with new technology use 
(Kleijnen et al., 2007). Time, a valuable resource for both individuals 
and businesses, cannot be replicated; therefore, services offering time 
savings gain an edge over others in the marketplace (Newell and Newell- 
Lemon, 2001). Efficient service delivery – particularly in the form of 
time convenience – has long been recognised to foster user perceptions 
of utilitarian value and, consequently, positive attitudes (Childers et al., 
2001). Unlike traditional banking systems that rely on intermediaries, 
CBDCs facilitate instant transactions, enhancing the efficiency of both 
domestic and international payments (He, 2021). This immediacy ben­
efits all stakeholders, accelerates economic activities, improves cash 
flow, and reduces the waiting times inherent in traditional banking 
(Martino, 2021). As a result, CBDC adoption can create a more dynamic 
and responsive financial ecosystem that meets the demands of the 
modern digital economy. Therefore, we postulated that the time-saving 
convenience associated with CBDC transactions would positively influ­
ence individuals’ attitudes towards its adoption. Thus, the following 
hypothesis can be articulated: 
H4.
Time convenience of CBDC will be positively associated with in­
dividual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.2. Constraint-based negative valences related to CBDC use
2.3.2.1. Cognitive effort. More broadly, cognitive effort encompasses 
information search (Kleijnen et al., 2007). High cognitive demands, as 
faced when understanding complex features or navigating unfamiliar 
technology (Suoranta et al., 2005), act as barriers to technology adop­
tion (Kleijnen et al., 2007). For example, mobile financial services often 
require significant effort to learn and use (Suoranta et al., 2005). 
Conversely, studies on mobile services and online shopping demonstrate 
that reduced cognitive effort leads to positive perceptions of the tech­
nology, encouraging adoption decisions (Kleijnen et al., 2007). Thus, we 
hypothesised that the effort spent acquiring CBDC information would be 
perceived as a psychological cost, negatively impacting individuals’ 
attitudes towards adoption. Moreover, increased effort spent under­
standing complex CBDC processes is likely to further undermine their 
attitudes. Hence, the following hypothesis can be articulated: 
H5.
Cognitive effort will be negatively associated with individual at­
titudes towards CBDC.
2.3.2.2. Perceived financial cost. The perceived financial cost, which 
encompasses transaction fees, service charges, and internet/phone ex­
penses, can hinder technology adoption (Arfi et al., 2021; Teutio et al., 
2023). This implies that when potential adopters of CBDC perceive the 
cost implications as relatively high, they are more likely to develop an 
unfavourable attitude towards the currency’s use. Notably, CBDC’s 
initial implementation and infrastructure costs are higher than those of 
traditional systems and other means of online payment such as PayPal 
(Anthony and Michel, 2023). Therefore, consistent with previous studies 
(Teutio et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2012), we proposed that high 
perceived financial costs for CBDC enrolment and usage, especially 
when its benefits are unclear, would act as a cost burden, thus negatively 
impacting individuals’ attitudes and, ultimately, their intention to adopt 
CBDC. In sum, the following hypothesis can be articulated: 
H6.
Perceived financial cost will be negatively associated with indi­
vidual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.2.3. Perceived risk. Perceived risk refers to the individual’s uncer­
tainty regarding potential consequences and outcomes involved in using 
or purchasing a product (Bauer, 1967; Yoo et al., 2020). Risk concerns 
have been viewed as a factor for CBDC acceptance (Kim et al., 2023) 
and, consequently, a barrier to the early adoption of CBDC (Gupta et al., 
2023). In practice and research, it is understood that perceived risk in­
hibits individuals from trialling new technologies. Moreover, perceived 
risk can also explain why rational individuals might choose to evaluate 
the costs and benefits associated with a technology (Featherman and 
Pavlou, 2003). Significantly, concerns about personal financial infor­
mation loss linked to CBDC use, as highlighted by Gupta et al. (2023), 
constitute a significant risk perception among potential users. Accord­
ingly, Kim et al. (2023) and Ozili (2023a) argued that effective risk 
mitigation by central banks is necessary for fostering positive percep­
tions and attitudes towards CBDC adoption. This suggests a strong 
negative relationship between perceived risk and attitudes towards 
CBDC use, supported by studies such as that of Kim et al. (2023), as 
individuals seek to avoid potential financial losses or identity theft 
associated with security breaches. Against this backdrop, the following 
hypothesis can be articulated: 
H7.
Perceived risk will be negatively associated with individual atti­
tudes towards CBDC.
2.3.3. Social cognitive factors associated with CBDC use
2.3.3.1. Lifestyle compatibility. In this study, lifestyle compatibility re­
fers to the extent to which the use of CBDC mirrors the lifestyle and 
experiences of the individual, ultimately fostering a positive attitude 
towards CBDC use. More broadly, lifestyle compatibility, akin to the 
alignment of lifestyle choices and values (Boateng et al., 2016), holds 
significance in addressing potential uncertainties associated with the 
integration of technology, specifically concerning a user’s values, ex­
periences, lifestyle, and preferences (see also Kimiagari and Baei, 2024; 
Osakwe et al., 2022b). It has long been recognised that lifestyle 
compatibility plays a vital role in influencing individual behaviour and 
confers substantial advantages in predicting consumers’ attitudinal and 
behavioural predispositions. Rogers (1995), for example, acknowledged 
that the acceptance of an innovation hinges on its compatibility with the 
user’s lifestyle. Furthermore, Armstrong et al. (2014) asserted that in­
dividual consumers do not merely decide to purchase a product; they 
consider the values and lifestyles embodied by the product in question. 
Following SCT, researchers such as Kimiagari and Baei (2024) and 
Osakwe et al. (2022b) highlighted lifestyle compatibility as key to 
shaping technology adoption attitudes (also see Joshi and Chawla, 
2023). Moreover, a study by Yoo et al. (2020) validated the positive link 
between compatibility and attitudes towards Bitcoin use. Based on the 
preceding discussion, we proposed that attitude towards CBDC in the 
context of our study would also hinge on how potential adopters of this 
digital currency perceive it aligns well with their lifestyles, preferences, 
and values. Hence, the following hypothesis was articulated: 
H8.
Lifestyle compatibility will be positively associated with individ­
ual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.3.2. Trust in the central bank. Trust can be broadly defined as a 
psychological state marked by the belief that a third party (trustee) 
possesses desirable attributes and will act competently, consistently, and 
C.N. Osakwe et al.

honestly per agreed-upon expectations (Kim and Peterson, 2017; S¨oilen 
and Benhayoun, 2022; Yu et al., 2015). In the context of the present 
study, the central bank, being the regulator of CBDC and banking- 
related matters, is the trustee that the public believes will act in their 
best interest by securing CBDC-enabled transactions. In behavioural 
research, the role that trust plays in the facilitation of both economic and 
non-economic transactions has been well documented. For instance, in 
their meta-analytic study, Kim and Peterson (2017) found that trust is 
one of the most powerful predictors of attitude. Indeed, scholars 
(Boateng et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2022) who leveraged SCT as their 
guiding framework argued that trust acts as a social cognition motiva­
tion for individuals’ desirable attitudinal and behavioural outcomes, 
thus implying that increases in trust are associated with favourable 
outcomes (see also Aziz et al., 2019; Ng and Lucianetti, 2016). More­
over, in the realm of fintech, researchers who investigated the rela­
tionship between trust and attitude in emerging markets (such as Ghana, 
India, Kenya, and Indonesia) have demonstrated that attitude is posi­
tively influenced by trust (Laksamana et al., 2023; Ogunmola and Das, 
2024; Osakwe et al., 2022a). Further, a substantial portion of these trust 
issues could stem from a broader scepticism surrounding the central 
bank’s capabilities to allay the fears and mistrust associated with 
blockchain technology, which often underpins CBDCs (Mazambani, 
2024). Despite blockchain’s reputation for security, high-profile 
breaches and vulnerabilities have raised concerns. For instance, aside 
from security concerns, regulatory uncertainty shrouding the blockchain 
landscape may contribute to distrust, as the public fears future regula­
tions that could impact the legality of their transactions. Similarly, 
blockchain technology is not easily understood by the public, which can 
lead to scepticism, as people tend to mistrust what they do not fully 
comprehend. Against this backdrop, we conjectured that positive atti­
tudes towards CBDC usage hinge on individuals perceiving the central 
bank as both trustworthy and aligned with public interests. Conversely, 
when individuals do not perceive the regulator as a credible and 
competent institution, their enthusiasm for CBDC adoption diminishes. 
Consequently, we hypothesised that higher levels of trust in the central 
bank correlate with more favourable attitudes towards CBDC use. Our 
proposed hypothesis can be articulated as follows: 
H9.
Trust in the central bank will be positively associated with indi­
vidual attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.3.3. Subjective norms. Subjective norms refer to perceptions of other 
people’s beliefs that stimulate interest in eitherperforming or abstaining 
from a contemplated behaviour (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen and Fishbein, 
1980). Since individuals are typically embedded within close-knit social 
networks, they will probably exhibit heightened susceptibility to the 
opinions of key figures and reference groups such as family and peers 
(see also Husin et al., 2016; Osakwe et al., 2022a). Drawing from both 
TRA and SCT, the study anticipated that subjective norms, rooted in the 
influence of conformity pressure and social endorsement, play an 
important role in shaping attitudes towards novel technologies, 
including CBDCs. In other words, evidence from prior research suggests 
that individuals may exhibit greater receptivity to CBDC adoption when 
encouraged by their social circles to explore this technology. However, it 
is essential to note that studies such as that by Gim´enez and Tamaj´on 
(2019) reported a nonsignificant relationship between subjective norms 
and attitudes towards digital currency use. Consequently, further 
investigation is warranted, particularly within the specific context of 
CBDCs. Nevertheless, by aligning with several previous empirical 
studies that found a positive association between subjective norms and 
attitude (e.g., Choi et al., 2014; Osakwe et al., 2022a), we proposed the 
following hypothesis: 
H10.
Subjective norms will be positively associated with individual 
attitudes towards CBDC.
2.3.3.4. Attitude and use intentions. Attitude, which encompasses feel­
ings, beliefs, and behavioural tendencies towards an entity, influences 
individuals’ intentions to engage with it (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; 
Osakwe et al., 2022a, 2022b). Recognising this link, researchers have 
explored (new) product/service adoption through attitudinal studies (e. 
g., Huang and Chueh, 2022; Ogunmola and Das, 2024; Osakwe et al., 
2022b). Importantly, within the financial services context, positive at­
titudes towards innovations such as mobile payments and virtual cur­
rencies have been demonstrated to promote their adoption (de Luna 
et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2023; Ogunmola and Das, 2024; Osakwe et al., 
2022a; Roh et al., 2022). Therefore, we hypothesised that a stronger 
positive attitude towards CBDC would correspond to a stronger inten­
tion to use it. However, inconsistent findings exist, such as Omar’s 
(2007) study on life insurance in Nigeria, which highlighted the need to 
further examine the relationship between attitude and CBDC adoption. 
Hence, the present study investigated whether individuals’ attitudes 
towards CBDC positively influence their usage intentions. Thus, the 
following hypothesis can be articulated: 
H11.
Individual attitudes will be positively associated with CBDC use 
intentions.
As Fig. 1 shows, all the hypotheses mentioned above are summarised 
in the form of a theoretical model.
3. Methodology
3.1. Study context
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial and financial hub, was selected as the 
research setting for this study due to its significant economic promi­
nence and cultural diversity. As Africa’s seventh largest economy (The 
Africa Report, 2020; Quartz Africa, 2016) with a population exceeding 
20 million (Lagos State Government Ministry of Economic Planning and 
Budget, 2019), Lagos drives technological innovation in the region. This 
city’s diverse cultural landscape reflects a microcosm of Nigerian soci­
ety, suggesting that findings from Lagos are likely to be highly gen­
eralisable across Nigeria. Therefore, it is an ideal location to investigate 
individual attitudes and intentions towards adopting CBDC, given its 
influential role in the national economy and societal structure.
3.2. Data collection and procedure
In this study, a three-pronged approach was utilised for data 
collection. First, after operationalising constructs based on the literature 
review, we invited seven experts (comprising two financial service 
practitioners and five academics) to review the questionnaire. Feedback 
from these experts improved the questionnaire’s clarity.
Second, a pre-test of the questionnaire was conducted at the research 
site using convenience sampling, involving 40 participants aged 18–55 
years. The pre-test yielded reliability scores ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, 
indicating modest-to-high internal consistency. These initial responses 
were discarded before the main data collection began. Using an a priori 
sample size calculator, the minimum required sample size for our model 
structure was estimated to be 166 (Soper, 2021).
For the main survey, conducted between November 2021 and March 
2022, we employed a mixed sampling approach of snowball and con­
venience sampling, similar to those employed in related studies (e.g., 
Fakfare et al., 2023). We distributed a total of 350 questionnaires, with 
an average response time of five days. Notably, for the questionnaires 
collected on the same day, the completion time averaged approximately 
15 min. In total, we received 310 completed questionnaires, resulting in 
a response rate of 88.5 %. Table 1 presents the demographic profile of 
the participants.

3.3. Measures
As previously mentioned, the measurement variables utilised in this 
study were derived from prior research, although they were modified to 
fit the context of the current investigation. Specifically, financial in­
clusion was assessed using a three-item scale adapted from the work of 
Teutio et al. (2023). A sample item for financial inclusion is “I believe 
that the access to basic financial services provided by central bank 
digital currency can enhance individuals’ access to financial services in 
society”. We measured seamless transactions with a three-item scale 
derived from the research of Ryu (2018). A sample items for seamless 
transactions is “I can use various financial services simultaneously (e.g., 
one-stop processing) when I use central bank digital currency”. A four- 
item scale from Xu et al. (2017) was employed to measure perceived 
superiority. A sample item of perceived superiority is “A central bank- 
backed digital currency is a breakthrough innovation compared to 
other forms of currency, including banknotes and coins”. We measured 
time convenience using a three-item scale adapted from Kleijnen et al. 
(2007). A sample items of time convenience is “Using central bank 
digital currency would allow me to save time”.
Cognitive effort was also measured using a three-item scale adapted 
from Kleijnen et al. (2007), with items such as “It will take considerable 
effort to understand how to use central bank digital currency”. We 
assessed perceived financial cost using a four-item scale derived from 
Arfi et al. (2021) and Teutio et al. (2023), with items such as “Signing up 
for and using central bank digital currency could be relatively expen­
sive”. Perceived risk was measured using a four-item scale adapted from 
Featherman and Pavlou (2003), with items such as “Compared to con­
ventional currencies (e.g., banknotes and coins), I believe that using 
central bank digital currency is riskier”.
Lifestyle compatibility was measured using a three-item scale 
adapted from two earlier studies (Boateng et al., 2016; Kleijnen et al., 
2007), with items such as “The use of central bank digital currency 
aligns with my financial service preferences”. We measured trust in the 
central bank using a four-item scale adapted from Osakwe et al. (2020), 
with a sample item being “Overall, the Central Bank of Nigeria will do 
everything to secure digital currency transactions for users”. We 
assessed subjective norms based on a three-item scale adapted from the 
work of Husin et al. (2016) and Osakwe et al. (2022a), with items such 
as “People close to me may influence my decision to use central bank 
digital currency”.
For the dependent variables in our PLS-SEM analysis, we utilised a 
three-item scale to measure attitudes towards CBDC, adapted from Aziz 
et al. (2019). A sample items for attitude is “In general, I highly regard 
the idea of using central bank digital currency”. Finally, we employed a 
three-item scale to measure use intentions, adapted from Venkatesh 
et al. (2003). A sample item for use intentions is “Overall, I am likely to 
use central bank digital currency in the future”.
All measurement variables in this study were based on a five-point 
scale using different anchors such as “strongly disagree” to “strongly 
agree”, “totally disagree” to “totally agree”, and “most unlikely” to 
“most likely”. The use of varied scale anchors was also intended to 
mitigate the incidence of common method bias, which is consistent with 
the recommendations put forward by Podsakoff et al. (2003).
3.4. Common method bias assessment
Since both dependent and independent variables stemmed from the 
same questionnaire, common method bias (CMB) posed a potential 
threat to the validity of our results. We proactively addressed this 
concern through several measures. First, we assured participant ano­
nymity by emphasising the confidentiality of their responses and 
informing them that we would only process their aggregate responses. 
Besides, we did not collect any personally sensitive information from 
them. Second, the questionnaire clarified that there were no “right” or 
“wrong” answers to encourage honest responses. Third, we informed 
participants that participation was voluntary, offered no incentives, 
obtained consent from all participants. Fourth, we aimed to minimise 
survey fatigue by keeping questionnaire items concise. Lastly, following 
established practices (Kock and Lynn, 2012; Pal et al., 2021; Osakwe 
et al., 2022c, 2020; Roh et al., 2022), we employed two statistical tests 
to assess CMB: Harman’s one-factor test and the full-collinearity lateral 
(FLA) approach. Harman’s one-factor unrotated test indicated a low risk 
of CMB, as the first factor explained <36.5 % of the variance, which is 
well below the 50 % threshold. Supporting the absence of CMB further, 
the FLA approach yielded an average full collinearity variance inflation 
factor (AFVIF) of 2.045, which is well below the conservative threshold 
of 3.3 (Kock and Lynn, 2012). This finding suggests that CMB has a 
negligible impact on the analysis (Pal et al., 2021; Osakwe et al., 2022c, 
2020).
3.5. Analytical approaches
Multiple analytical approaches were employed in this study. First, 
we relied on the factor-based PLS-SEM to test the hypotheses. According 
to Kock (2019), factor-based PLS-SEM provides relatively more efficient 
parameters than earlier PLS methods. Most importantly, the use of PLS- 
SEM has been informed by the exploratory and predictive nature of this 
investigation and is, therefore, consistent with the work of Hair et al. 
(2019, 2020). Additionally, given that PLS-SEM is generally more robust 
at handling data with non-normal distribution, as was the case with our 
dataset, it was appropriate to apply this statistical method. The software 
that facilitated our statistical analysis was WarpPLS 8 (Kock, 2022). To 
complement the PLS-SEM analysis and gain deeper insights into CBDC 
adoption, we also employed fsQCA. Similar approaches can be found in 
recent studies such as those by Loh et al. (2023), McLeay et al. (2022), 
and Yee et al. (2021).
Notably, fsQCA leverages principles of complexity theory to uncover 
configurations of factors influencing adoption that may remain hidden 
by regression-based techniques such as PLS-SEM (Fiss, 2011; Pappas and 
Woodside, 2021; Woodside, 2014; Ragin, 2009). While PLS-SEM excels 
at analysing the net effects of individual factors, it faces limitations in 
revealing complex relationships and conditionalities. The results from 
the two complementary approaches should provide more valuable

CBDC.
4. Results
4.1. Results of hypothesis testing using PLS-SEM
4.1.1. Measurement model
Following Hair et al. (2020), we confirmed that our measurement 
model meets accepted standards. Specifically, all convergent validity 
and reliability coefficients surpass the recommended thresholds (see 
Hair et al., 2020). Detailed information on loadings, reliability scores, 
and convergent validity scores can be found in Table 2.
Table 3 presents discriminant validity scores calculated using Fornell 
and Larcker’s (1981) approach, and all scores support the distinctness of 
our measurement variables. Moreover, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio 
(HTMT) approach (Roemer et al., 2021) provided additional confirma­
tion for discriminant validity (see Appendix Table 1).
4.1.2. Structural model
Different evaluative criteria, including the predictive power of the 
hypothesised model using Stone–Geisser’s Q2 coefficients and R2 sta­
tistic, were employed to test the structural model parameters.
Both the Stone–Geisser Q2 values of 0.658 for attitude and 0.497 for 
use intention, as reported in Table 4, substantially surpass the threshold 
of zero, signifying a strong predictive relevance of the hypothesised 
model. Furthermore, the hypothesised model explained 65.1 % of the 
variance in attitude towards CBDC and 49.25 % of the variance in CBDC 
use intentions.
Notably, PLS-SEM partially or fully supported eight of the eleven 
hypothesised relationships (Table 4). H7, H9, and H10 did not reach 
statistical significance. Time convenience, financial inclusion, and 
seamless transactions emerged as the strongest predictors of a positive 
attitude towards CBDC, followed by perceived financial cost. This sug­
gests that individuals’ considerations regarding CBDC use are primarily 
driven by affordance-based positive valences. All four identified positive 
valences significantly and positively related to attitude, indicating a 
greater salience of both individual and societal benefits than constraint- 
based negative valences such as perceived risk or social cognitions such 
as subjective norms in predicting attitudes towards CBDC use.
4.1.3. Robustness check
To ensure the robustness of our hypothesised model, we employed a 
comprehensive set of model fit metrics, drawing from recent research 
(Kock, 2022; Osakwe et al., 2020; Shibin et al., 2020). These metrics 
included the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR), Symp­
son’s paradox ratio (SPR), average block variance inflation factor 
(AVIF), R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR), statistical suppression 
ratio (SSR), and nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR).
As Table 5 shows, the SRMR value of 0.052 was well below the 
acceptable threshold of 0.1, indicating a good model fit (Kock, 2022). 
Additionally, the NLBCDR of 0.773 exceeded the acceptable threshold of 
0.7, indicating that our structural model is less susceptible to reverse 
causality (Kock, 2022). Collectively, these findings support the

robustness and validity of our structural model.
4.2. Results from fsQCA
Following the initial model estimation, and as mentioned previously, 
this study extended its analysis by conducting fsQCA to examine the 
specific configurations of antecedent conditions that would yield use 
intention. In particular, it is crucial to recognise that use intention is a 
multifaceted outcome influenced by numerous factors. No singular 
factor possesses the ability to entirely dictate use intention. To address 
this complexity, we utilised asymmetric fsQCA to explore the nuanced 
configurations of conditions necessary and sufficient for high CBDC use 
intention. First, we performed contrarian case analysis and data cali­
bration. Then, we examined the necessary and sufficient conditions for 
high use intentions. Details of these analyses are provided below.
4.2.1. Contrarian case analysis and data calibration
First, a contrarian case analysis was conducted to investigate the 
existence of contrarian cases within the group of antecedent conditions 
of the intention to use CBDC. Following Woodside (2014), the variables 
were transformed into quintiles. The outcomes of the contingency table 
analysis conducted using SPSS software are presented in Appendix 
Table 2. The next step in our analysis was data calibration, which 
transformed raw data by assigning membership scores ranging from 0.0 
to 1.0 (Ragin, 2009), where a score of 0.0 signified complete non- 
membership in the set, a score of 0.5 marked the crossover point, and 
a score of 1.0 indicated full-set membership (Rihoux, 2006). Accord­
ingly, as the study utilised a five-point Likert scale, the calibration an­
chor for full membership was set at a value of 5, full non-membership at 
1, and the crossover point at 3.
4.2.2. Results of the analysis of the necessary conditions
After successfully calibrating the data into fuzzy sets, the subsequent 
step involved a necessary condition analysis (NCA). Focusing on use 
intention as the outcome condition, this analysis aimed to ascertain 
whether any of the antecedent conditions were necessary for the pres­
ence or absence of use intention. A consistency range was measured 
between 0 and 1 (Rihoux, 2006), and a condition was deemed “neces­
sary” when its consistency exceeded 0.9 (Ragin, 2009).

central bank and lifestyle compatibility, as well as a positive attitude 
towards CBDCs, are all identified as necessary conditions for use 
intention. Time convenience stands out as the only positive valence 
condition not considered necessary for high use intention; however, 
with a consistency >0.8, it is regarded as “almost always necessary” 
(Ragin, 2000). Interestingly, none of the constraint-based negative 
valence conditions emerged as necessary for high use intention.
4.2.3. Results of the analysis of sufficient conditions
The analysis of sufficient conditions began with constructing a truth 
table following Ragin’s (2009) methodology. A truth table consisting of 
2k rows (where k represents the number of conditions, and each row 
corresponds to a potential combination) was generated using a fuzzy-set 
algorithm. Subsequently, the truth table was refined by eliminating rows 
with a frequency <3, considering that the study’s sample exceeded 150 
(Fiss, 2011), and the consistency threshold was set at 0.9. The resultant 
fsQCA outcomes present three solutions: complex, parsimonious, and 
intermediate. In this study, the intermediate solution is selected as it is 
preferred in terms of its interpretability and completeness (Ragin, 2009). 
The specific results can be found in Table 7.
The findings presented in Table 7 reveal a “do not care” scenario for 
perceived superiority in C5, creating a discrepancy with the outcomes of 
the necessary condition analysis as depicted in Table 6. Adopting the 
perspective of Mattke et al. (2021), perceived superiority was not 
considered a necessary condition for high use intention. A similar 
argument applies to lifestyle compatibility in C6.
Table 7 presents six configurations associated with high CBDC use 
intention. The total solution coverage stood at 0.757, while the overall 
solution consistency reached an impressive 0.995, signifying that 
approximately 76 % of the outcome was covered by the six solutions. 
Configurations one to four (C1–C4) established financial inclusion, 
seamless transactions, perceived superiority, time convenience, lifestyle 
compatibility, trust in the central bank, and attitude as foundational 
elements generating high use intention. Within C1, the absence of 
perceived financial cost was introduced as perceived risk, cognitive ef­
forts, and subjective norms prove inconsequential. In C2, cognitive 
effort was excluded, given the inconsequential role of perceived finan­
cial cost, perceived risk, and subjective norms. C3 introduced the pres­
ence of perceived risk to the baseline as perceived financial cost, 
cognitive effort, and subjective norms proved inconsequential. In C4, the 
inclusion of subjective norms complements the baseline, with perceived 
financial cost, cognitive effort, and perceived risk proving inconse­
quential. Configurations five to six (C5–C6) established financial inclu­
sion, seamless transactions, time convenience, trust in the central bank, 
and attitude as the fundamental components for solutions yielding high 
use intention. In C5, the exclusion of perceived financial cost, cognitive 
effort, perceived risk, and subjective norms was introduced as perceived 
superiority proved inconsequential. Finally, C6 incorporated perceived 
superiority alongside perceived financial cost, perceived risk, and sub­
jective norms as lifestyle compatibility proved inconsequential.
4.2.4. Predictive validity
Furthermore, the predictive validity of the outcome configuration 
was assessed as recommended by Woodside (2014). Thus, in line with 
previous studies (e.g., Olya and Al-Ansi, 2018), the original dataset was 
divided into two subsamples. As Table 8 illustrates, the causal config­
urations influencing use intention in Subsample 1 were examined using 
an XY plot of data from Subsample 2. The configurations, coverage, and 
consistency observed in subsample 2 closely mirrored those from the 
original sample, particularly C2 and C4. This confirmed the predictive 
validity of the proposed model, affirming the study’s robustness 
(Skaaning, 2011).
4.2.5. Evaluation of complexity theory
The preceding findings were assessed following Woodside’s (2014)
five tenets of complexity theory. The first tenet posits that a condition 
may be necessary but is rarely sufficient for yielding a high or low 
outcome condition. Supporting this tenet, the study’s NCA and suffi­
ciency analysis revealed that the necessary conditions were solely 
insufficient for predicting high use intention. The second tenet states 
that a complex condition of two or more conditions is sufficient for a 
consistently high score in an outcome condition. Table 7 illustrates in­
stances supporting this, where a complex combination of antecedents 
was sufficient for consistently high scores in the outcome condition, as 
observed in C6. The third tenet asserts that a sufficient model is un­
necessary for an outcome with a high score. Table 7 demonstrates sup­
port for this principle, indicating that the six alternative models for high 
use intention were sufficient but not necessary. The fourth tenet states 
that a condition in a recipe can contribute positively or negatively to a 
specific outcome depending on the presence or absence of the other 
ingredients in the recipe. For instance, perceived financial cost, 
perceived risk, and subjective norms played both positive and negative 
roles (C4, C5, and C6) in predicting use intention as depicted in Table 7, 
thus supporting Tenet 4.
Lastly, the fifth tenet posits that for high Y scores, a given recipe is 
relevant for some but not all cases (i.e., coverage is <1.00 for any one 
recipe). The findings presented in Table 7 demonstrate that the coverage 
of each solution was below 1, providing support for Tenet 5. In 
conclusion, the five tenets of complexity theory, as discussed, found 
support in the study’s analysis, affirming the complex relationship 
among various factors related to CBDC use intentions.

5. Discussion, implications, and recommendations for future 
research
5.1. Discussion
Results from the PLS-SEM analysis revealed that all the positive 
valence factors explored are significantly associated with individual 
attitudes towards CBDC. These findings corroborate numerous studies 
(e.g., Ryu, 2018; Xu et al., 2017; Kleijnen et al., 2007) that have 
demonstrated the role of seamless transactions, perceived superiority, 
and time convenience in shaping user attitudes and intentions, partic­
ularly regarding the adoption of emerging technologies.
Although the finding that the societal benefit of financial inclusion 
positively correlates with attitudes towards CBDC constitutes a novel 
contribution to CBDC research, it is consistent with the findings of 
Teutio et al. (2023), who found that mobile money usage exhibited a 
positive correlation with financial inclusion. Our study also indicates 
that a favourable attitude towards CBDC usage is strongly associated 
with its potential to enhance financial inclusion, which resonates with 
the findings of Wang et al. (2023), who established that consumer per­
ceptions of the societal benefits of CBDCs in China can stimulate their 
willingness to utilise CBDCs.
While perceived financial cost significantly influences attitudes to­
wards CBDC (see Ogunmola and Das, 2024 for similar findings), the 
cognitive effort is only marginally significant, while the perceived risk is 
nonsignificant. However, other studies (Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al.,

2023) indicate that perceived risk in CBDC significantly deters user 
adoption. This study’s nonsignificant claim could stem from the missed 
reaction that trails the underlying technology of CBDCs: blockchain. 
Meanwhile, the lack of support for a negative relationship between 
perceived risk and attitudes in the present study aligns with the findings 
of Ma et al.’s (2022) study conducted in the Chinese context, which 
similarly observed that perceived risk alone might not be a sufficient 
deterrent for individuals’ adoption of CBDC.
In our analysis of social cognitive factors, we found that lifestyle 
compatibility exhibits marginal significance, while trust in the central 
bank and subjective norms do not yield significant effects. Notably, 
existing studies (Laksamana et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2022; Osakwe et al., 
2022a; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 2022) consistently emphasised the 
importance of trust and subjective norms as predictors of individuals’ 
attitudes and fintech adoption. However, a marked distinction lies in our 
study’s specific focus on trust levels in the regulator, specifically the 
central bank. This specificity may account for the variance between our 
findings and those of prior research. Meanwhile, our nonsignificant re­
sults align with a related study by Gim´enez and Tamaj´on (2019), which 
also failed to support the positive impact of both trust and subjective 
norms on attitudes towards digital currency use. Interestingly, our study 
diverges from a CBDC investigation in India, which found that perceived 
trust significantly diminishes attitudes towards the digital Rupee 
(Ogunmola and Das, 2024).
From the asymmetrical analysis, it is evident that all positive valence 
factors (except for perceived superiority) were present in the six re­
ported configurations. This finding corroborates the significant re­
lationships of these factors observed in the SEM analysis. Further, the 
absence of perceived superiority in C5 could be explained by the 
necessary absence of negative valence, which then makes it perceived as 
superior compared to traditional alternatives fraught with these nega­
tive valences. More specifically, the first four configurations (i.e., C1–C4 
in Table 7) signify that affordance-based positive valence, com­
plemented by trust in the central bank, lifestyle compatibility, and 
positive attitudes towards CBDC, are crucial for CBDC use intentions. In 
essence, the early adoption of CBDC hinges on the complementarity of 
positive valences, trust in the central bank, lifestyle compatibility, and a 
favourable attitude towards CBDC. While these findings represent a 
novel contribution within the CBDC adoption context, they also support 
the broader claims in fintech research, specifically, the significance of 
perceived benefits (analogous to positive valences in our study), trust, 
compatibility, and overall attitude in shaping the adoption and use of 
fintech (e.g., Joshi and Chawla, 2023; Pal et al., 2021; Ryu, 2018; S¨oilen 
and Benhayoun, 2022).
As C5 (Table 7) reveals, central to CBDC adoption is trust in the 
central bank and compatibility with individuals’ lifestyles, both com­
plemented by positive perceptions of the technology’s benefits and 
limited downsides (i.e., mitigated valences). Moreover, C6 (Table 7) 
presents the most intricate scenario for CBDC adoption. High positive 
perceptions of benefits (i.e., affordance-based positive valences), sub­
jective norms, and positive attitudes can still drive high use intentions, 
even in the face of potential drawbacks like perceived cost and risk and 
regardless of lifestyle compatibility. However, this requires a lower 
perception of cognitive effort associated with using CBDC.
Collectively, these findings provide deeper insights into the decision- 
making process for CBDC adoption, extending beyond the initial SEM- 
based results. Thus, they complement and expand upon previous 
CBDC adoption studies (such as Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; 
Ogunmola and Das, 2024; Wang et al., 2023).
5.2. Implications for theory
This study has significant implications for theory development in the 
field of CBDC research and, more broadly, fintech literature. Drawing 
upon the PLS-SEM findings, this study demonstrates that affordance- 
based positive valences (such as time convenience and seamless 
transactions) outweigh constraint-based negative valences and socio- 
environmental and personal cognition factors in predicting positive at­
titudes towards CBDC. Therefore, maximising these positive valences 
becomes crucial for fostering favourable attitudes towards CBDCs.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind within 
the CBDC context. Thus, it should motivate future research to explore 
additional positive valences associated with CBDC use, extending 
beyond the scope of our study. Furthermore, our research aligns with the 
empirical support found in Yoo et al.’s (2020) research on Bitcoin and 
Jain and Raman’s (2022) study on digital finance, where similar results 
were observed in their respective research contexts.
Additionally, this study highlights that the societal benefit of finan­
cial inclusion plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals’ favourable 
attitudes towards CBDC. This resonates with Wang et al.’s (2023) find­
ings, which emphasised the social advantages linked to CBDC, including 
its potential for promoting anti-fraud measures, a cashless society, and 
improved monetary policy performance. Moreover, our findings align 
with the fintech literature of African countries (such as Ekong and 
Ekong, 2022; Ozili, 2018, 2023a, 2023b), which has arguments that 
individuals in underserved markets, such as Nigeria, may exhibit greater 
receptivity to fintech innovations, including CBDC.
Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this research represents 
the first exploration within the CBDC domain to identify the core pre­
requisites for early CBDC adoption, particularly at the individual- 
consumer level and in a CBDC pioneer nation such as Nigeria. Our 
necessary condition analysis reveals five main prerequisite factors for 
high CBDC use intentions, including consumer perceptions of CBDC’s 
societal benefits (measured by financial inclusion), seamless trans­
actions, lifestyle compatibility, trust in the central bank, and a positive 
attitude towards CBDC. Future research can build upon these findings to 
develop deeper insights into the prerequisites for facilitating CBDC 
adoption, thereby enriching scholarly understanding of this important 
topic. Overall, our study illuminates the necessary conditions for CBDC 
uptake and, by extension, government-enabled financial tools.
Additionally, this research contributes significantly to the existing 
knowledge based on its sufficiency analysis related to CBDC adoption. 
Notably, it represents one of the earliest scientific endeavours to reveal 
the multiple pathways leading to high use intentions of CBDC, which 
serves as a proxy for early CBDC adoption. Specifically, we identified six 
distinct paths that converge towards the same outcome: (high) use in­
tentions for CBDC. Previously, research in this domain primarily focused 
on exploring individual antecedent factors influencing CBDC use 
intention (see Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Ogunmola and Das, 
2024; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 2022; Wang et al., 2023); however, this 
narrow approach has limited both empirical investigations and scholarly 
progress. In contrast, the present study light on how positive and 
negative valences, along with social and personal cognitions, collec­
tively shape CBDC adoption. Moreover, it responds to recent calls within 
technology-based research by integrating SEM with complementary 
methods such as fsQCA (Loh et al., 2023; McLeay et al., 2022; Yee et al., 
2021).
This methodological contribution not only sets a precedent for 
investigating complex phenomena like adoption intentions in the 
emerging CBDC domain but also provides a roadmap for future studies 
seeking to understand CBDC adoption decisions.
Finally, combining valence theory (Peter and Tarpey Sr, 1975), SCT 
(Bandura, 1989), and TRA (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980), our analysis il­
luminates how individuals decide to adopt CBDCs. This integrative 
approach not only improves understanding of the topic but also 
strengthens the external validity, and ultimately the predictive power, of 
these theories.
5.3. Implications for policy and SDGs
This study provides actionable insights for both central bank au­
thorities and their media partners. First, the PLS-SEM analysis revealed a

more dominant role for affordance-based positive valences like financial 
inclusion and time convenience in shaping CBDC user attitudes 
compared to (constraint-based) negative valences like cost and risk. This 
suggests that maximising perceived benefits through targeted in­
terventions and awareness campaigns could be an effective strategy for 
promoting CBDC uptake. Policymakers could prioritise initiatives that 
highlight the societal benefits of financial inclusion associated with 
CBDC use, alongside its advantages in terms of seamless transactions, 
time convenience, and perceived superiority over existing payment 
methods.
Second, and relatedly, this study demonstrated that improving the 
initial adoption of CBDC hinges on four significant factors: the societal 
benefit of financial inclusion, seamless transactions, central bank trust, 
and positive individual attitudes. Therefore, policymakers must priori­
tise strategies in these areas to unlock the full potential of CBDCs for 
both individuals and society. One such strategy includes employing 
transparent communication campaigns to build trust and investing 
heavily in user-centric technology to improve transaction speed and 
transparency.
Third, the fsQCA analysis revealed six actionable configurations 
driving high CBDC use intentions, transcending prior single-factor ap­
proaches (Gupta et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; S¨oilen and Benhayoun, 
2022). This unveils the intricate interplay of adoption conditions, of­
fering valuable insights for central bank management to tailor strategies 
for promoting widespread CBDC use. Notably, the analysis underscores 
the absence of a singular “best” solution; instead, suggesting that mul­
tiple pathways can lead to high CBDC adoption (as proxied by use in­
tentions). This implies that central banks can choose from a variety of 
effective strategies (see Table 7) to facilitate CBDC uptake. Consider 
solution four (C4, Table 7) as one example among the six solutions. Here, 
the central bank could prioritise campaigns and educational content 
focused on the four identified affordance-based positive valences 
alongside the factors of subjective norms, trust in the regulator, and 
individual attitude. This holistic approach can effectively stimulate in­
dividuals’ use of CBDC.
Finally, beyond the practical implications of our study for central 
bank authorities and their media partners, the study’s findings – 
particularly, the role of the societal positive valence of financial inclu­
sion as an important factor for CBDC adoption (measured by use in­
tentions here) – contribute to the current debate (e.g., Better Than Cash 
Alliance, 2023; Michael et al., 2022; Ozili, 2023b) on the nexus between 
fintech and the realisation of some of the laudable United Nations Sus­
tainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 9 (industry, inno­
vation and infrastructure) and SDG 10 (reduced socioeconomic 
inequalities). The research participants also highlighted a broader social 
motivation for using CBDCs, as they believe it can benefit the commu­
nity, particularly by promoting financial inclusion, which contributes to 
sustainable and inclusive development. Interestingly, their willingness 
to use CBDCs in light of our findings also suggests it could promote 
sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12). This is partly due to 
the potential cost reduction in printing paper currency if CBDCs are 
widely adopted.
5.4. Limitations and recommendations for future studies
We must acknowledge the limitations of the present study. In 
particular, despite employing a multi-theoretical and multi-method 
approach, we recognise the possibility of overlooking relevant factors 
influencing individuals’ CBDC attitudes and intentions. Therefore, we 
encourage future researchers to explore alternative theoretical frame­
works to expand our understanding of this topic. Cross-country studies 
on CBDC adoption can further broaden the research base and provide 
valuable insights into the interplay of adoption factors across diverse 
contexts. This is important as previous studies highlight the role of na­
tional culture in CBDC adoption (Luu et al., 2023). By applying Hof­
stede’s national culture dimensions in this study’s context, we found 
that the public may readily adopt CBDCs if they are endorsed by 
respected authorities, promoted through community-based initiatives, 
positioned as competitive and experimental, and capable of offering 
immediate rewards. We also acknowledge that this may significantly 
differ in other study contexts due to varying cultural influences. For 
instance, the applicability of our tested model to other CBDC pioneers, 
such as the Bahamas and Jamaica, warrants further exploration. In this 
regard, scholars could explore the role of cultural values, particularly at 
the individual level, in shaping CBDC adoption decisions. We believe 
that such an exploration would further enrich scholarly and policy­
makers’ understanding of the CBDC adoption decision-making process.
Moreover, given the nascent stage of CBDC development globally, 
qualitative research offers unique insights that quantitative methods 
alone may not fully uncover. While the present study, as well as previous 
ones (Kim et al., 2023; Ogunmola and Das, 2024; Wang et al., 2023), 
have made significant contributions, qualitative approaches can provide 
a deeper understanding of contextual nuances. Academics are, there­
fore, encouraged to explore CBDC adoption decision-making qualita­
tively, especially in countries currently contemplating CBDC 
introduction or where it has already been rolled out, such as the 
Bahamas and Nigeria.
