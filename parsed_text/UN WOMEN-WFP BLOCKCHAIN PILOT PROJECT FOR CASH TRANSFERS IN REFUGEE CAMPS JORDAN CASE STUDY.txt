In February 2016, WFP began using iris scans 
to allow refugees in Jordan to purchase 
food at camp supermarkets. In January 2017, 
WFP initiated a pilot project in Pakistan, to 
test the use of blockchain for authenticating 
and registering beneficiary transactions. 
After refining both projects, in mid-2017, 
the Building Blocks pilot began in Za’atari 
and Azraq refugee camps. Today, 106,000 
refugees in these camps can use their 
entitlements to purchase groceries after 
scanning their iris at store checkouts. There 
are currently 126,832 Syrian refugees living 
in Jordanian camps, and half are female.1
Breaking new ground, UN Women partnered with the World Food Programme (WFP) to pilot test 
the use of blockchain technology to transfer salaries to women enrolled in Oases cash-for-work 
programmes in Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps, beginning in June 2019. The pilot reached 467 
women and has been expanded to all four camp-based Oases in June 2020 in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Simulation lab and live test 
In January 2018, UN Women hosted a 
‘Blockchain Simulation Lab and Live Test’ 
in New York, in partnership with Innovation 
Norway and the UN Office of Information 
and 
Communications 
Technology. 
The 
four-day simulation lab spurred a range of 
stakeholders to explore blockchain’s use 
in humanitarian contexts, through practical 
applications. 
Private-sector 
companies 
presented cutting-edge blockchain-based 
solutions that addressed current challenges 
faced by women and girls in humanitarian 
settings. Following the Simulation Lab 
and a corporate level Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) on collaboration for 
innovation, UN Women Jordan entered a 
partnership with WFP to use blockchain 
technology 
to 
assist 
Syrian 
refugee 
women participating in its cash-for-work 
programmes at the Za’atari and Azraq 
refugee camps, building the system for the 
first transactions to take place in 2019. 
UN Women blockchain pilot
Under the Building Blocks inter-agency pilot, 
UN Women’s foray into blockchain began in 
Za’atari in June 2019 and Azraq in September 
2019, involving nearly 200 vulnerable Syrian 
refugee women per month who are enrolled 
in incentive-based volunteering (also known 
as cash-for-work) programmes at two of its 
four Oasis Centers for the Resilience and 
Empowerment of Women. By leveraging 
this system, participants’ cash-for-work 
entitlements are stored securely on UN 
Women’s blockchain node. To access their 
funds – either as cash or to pay for goods – 
beneficiaries go to WFP-run supermarkets, 
where an iris scan identifies and links them 
to their blockchain account.
Benefits of using blockchain during the 
COVID-19 pandemic
In light of the measures adopted in March 
2020 by the Jordanian Government to 
prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, 
the benefits of blockchain have become 
even more palpable. As UN Women 
beneficiaries were no longer able to 
physically work at the Oases, the system 
quickly shifted to cash assistance, ensuring 
no disruption to their incomes. Although the 
lockdown restricted UN staff movement, the 
blockchain system allowed salaries to be 
managed and transferred remotely, with no 
interruptions. 
Meanwhile, beneficiaries in the non-pilot 
Oases experienced a delay in receiving their 
salaries since the outbreak of the pandemic 
in March 2020, which had to be physically 
collected once partners were finally granted 
a permit allowing them to enter the camp.
Moreover, restrictions on all people’s 
movement during the lockdown have meant 
that refugees are only allowed to leave
home to go to the supermarket or to seek

medical assistance. As such, the supermarket 
has proven to be a strategic location for UN 
Women beneficiaries involved in the pilot to 
continue receiving their salaries. In addition, 
the IrisGuard biometric scan is contactless, 
so beneficiaries need not touch any buttons 
to pay for groceries, the way others must 
if using cards, making it a safer and more 
hygienic method. 
In fact, UN Women’s blockchain cash-
disbursement system has made it one of 
the few humanitarian actors in Jordan that 
have been able to seamlessly and remotely 
ensure that cash continues to reach 
beneficiaries involved. This unexpected 
emergency situation has provided valuable 
lessons for the pilot’s future continuation 
and the decision to expand it to cover the 
nearly 2,500 yearly participants in Oases 
camp-based 
cash-for-work 
programmes 
– as well as for its potential rollout to host 
communities in partnership with WFP in 
future.
The results
Cumulatively, from June 2019 - April 2020, 
467 women cash-for-work beneficiaries 
have participated in the pilot: 254 in Za’atari 
and another 213 in Azraq. Baseline and 
midline monitoring reports were conducted 
with different beneficiary rotations, in June, 
November and December 2019 and in 
January 2020 to assess their experiences. 
External independent researchers from the 
University of Oxford’s Internet Institute also 
prepared a value assessment of the pilot’s 
partnerships and impact, after a series of 
visits, observations, interviews and 18 focus 
group discussions with 101 beneficiaries in 
December 2019. 
Findings have also emerged from a wider 
context of multi-stakeholder discussions 
and value analysis workshops about the 
pilot, involving several UN agencies, and 
the private sector partners. These reports 
and inputs have all served to assess the 
pilot’s impact, for beneficiaries and the 
organization.

Impact for beneficiaries
Flexibility and access to cash
Women’s 
salaries 
are 
now 
deposited 
weekly, as opposed to monthly, giving them 
more flexibility in how often they can access 
their funds. Previously, women received a 
physical cash payment of their salaries on 
a monthly set date directly at the Oases. 
Under the new system, women can also 
choose how to use their funds: as cash-
back, applying it towards purchases at the 
supermarket, or saving some or all of it. The 
cash-back function is unique to UN Women, 
as WFP recipients can only apply their 
entitlements to supermarket purchases.
In baseline reports at both camps, common 
responses as to why the process was 
beneficial included: that recipients can 
‘save money easily’, ‘access their salary 
whenever they desire,’ and that women 
‘are permitted to leave the home for this 
purpose’ and so it provides them with some 
welcomed freedom to their movement. The 
value assessment concluded that overall, 
taking into account the variation in financial 
circumstances and money management 
strategies, an important benefit of the pilot 
was that it provides everyone with choice.2
The same report cited a respondent who 
said: “I like that this week I can withdraw the 
salary whenever I need it, but when I don’t 
need it, I can keep it till the end of the month.” 3
Reliability and convenience
In both Za’atari and Azraq, the Oases are in 
close proximity to the supermarkets – both 
less than a 5-minute walk away – making 
them a convenient location.
Despite some initial problems with knowing 
when salaries would be deposited, 100% of 
the beneficiaries consulted for the baseline 
report in Azraq said that they had not faced 
problems in the disbursement process, as did 
94% in Za’atari. Reported problems related 
mostly to the periodic lack of cash available 
at the supermarket – which has since been 
addressed by UN Women and WFP directly 
with the vendors. In a midline assessment 
in December 2019, all 114 respondents con-
firmed that they are regularly informed when 
entitlements are added to their balances by 
UN Women staff. Moreover, 92% confirmed 
that with the blockchain approach they have 
never had cash shortfalls.
It is worth mentioning that the endline as-
sessment was due to take place in May 2020. 
However, due to global travel restrictions 
and confinement measures adopted in both 
refugee camps as result of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the exercise has been postponed 
to 2021 once circumstances will allow.
Control, safety and security
The ‘digital wallet’ was seen as a more 
secure way for participants to safeguard

their money, akin to a bank. According 
to an independent value assessment of 
the pilot, there have been no reported in-
stances of victimization or theft from women 
collecting their salary.4 In baseline reports, 
respondents in Za’atari called the biometric 
process “safer”. One noted: “Little by little, I 
take money instead of taking a big amount, 
because maybe I would lose it.” Another 
woman, from Azraq, specifically stated: “I 
feel safe knowing what I spend and what I 
save”. 
The blockchain also increases women’s agen-
cy and control over their salaries, extending 
their financial independence as the iris-scan 
process at the supermarket checkout ensures 
that only the owner of the wallet can access 
the cash. The independent value assess-
ment cites some women as saying that the 
system “protects women who are abused and 
have no say.”5 In baseline reports in Za’atari, 
one beneficiary noted that “the recipient is 
the  only one who can withdraw, so children 
or husbands cannot access your money,” 
while another said: “the Iris scanner is good 
because it doesn’t let the children go to re-
trieve it or other family members who waste 
their money on cigarettes and things that 
are not useful.” 
Ability to save and budget
In the baseline report at the Azraq refugee 
camp, 
89% 
respondents 
said 
that 
a 
“digital wallet” is better for their financial 
management; and 78% of respondents in 
Za’atari noted the same. Of those 89%, the
majority claimed the digital wallet is better 
than cash because they ‘can withdraw 
money whenever they need to’, and ‘it is 
better to save money’. One beneficiary from 
Za’atari said “I feel it helps me and may 
give me ideas on how to save a little bit of 
money.” 
The independent value assessment noted 
that despite the shared understanding that 
long-term saving was impossible, there was

Our impact: Aisha Salam, 36, arrived in Za’atari 
refugee camp in 2014 from Damascus, and had 
to find a way to support herself, as well as, her 
three children. She enrolled in the Oasis Center 
as a teaching assistant and childcare provider, 
which allowed her to pay for the medication 
her daughter required and provide for the 
family’s needs. “Being able to save money for 
my daughter’s medication is very important 
to me,” Salam explained. “For myself and I 
know for many other women, it is reassuring 
to know that no one else can take the money 
or take advantage of our salaries.”

indication that some participants put money 
aside for budgeting, with one woman 
saying: “I might put some money aside for 
a specific purchase, to buy important things 
like a mattress or pillow covers or a water 
filter.”6 Blockchain records also show that
there were 3,246 unique transactions during 
the pilot, meaning beneficiaries each made 
seven transactions on average in one month. 
This indicates that they are not cashing out 
their full salary once a month but using their 
e-wallets much like bank accounts that they 
can access regularly.  
Our impact: in 2012, Ibtsam Sayeed Ahmed 
fled Syria after a bomb fell on her family home 
in Dar’aa, which left her with life-changing 
injuries. Ahmed spent the next three years in 
and out of the hospital to fully recover, “I had 
to learn to walk again, to adjust to only having 
one hand, support myself, and ultimately learn 
how to live in a new way,” she remembers. 
Ahmed lives alone and has the responsibil-
ity of financially supporting herself, so when 
an opportunity came to enroll in the UN 
Women Oasis Center, she took the position. 
 
As part of UN Women’s incentive-based 
volunteer programme at the Oasis, Ahmed 
now earns a salary as a qualified Remedial 
Education Teacher, “(The position) allowed 
me to financially support myself and save 
money to pay for my medical bills.” To sup-
port women like Ahmed enrolled in the Oasis 
Centers, UN Women in partnership with the 
World Food Programme (WFP), and IrisGuard 
provide secure access to their funds and sav-
ings through blockchain assistance. “Knowing 
that I have the option to save money has made 
a difference in the way that I spend money and 
think about the future,” Ahmed affirms.

“We know that women in crisis situations 
and displacement settings tend to have lower 
digital literacy than men, and often lack ac-
cess to the technology and connectivity that 
are so critical in today’s world. UN Women 
is partnering with WFP to change this by us-
ing innovative technology to drive change 
for women in the most challenging settings 
and to accelerate progress towards women’s 
economic empowerment on a large scale.” 
—UN Women Executive Director Phumzile 
Mlambo-Ngcuka  
Digital and financial literacy
To increase the financial literacy of its 
beneficiaries, UN Women has provided 
expense-tracking and budgeting seminars 
at its Oases. 
In the baseline report for Azraq, where 
99% of respondents reported having their 
own phone, 81% stated that they can use 
their phone to track their expenditures and 
savings, while 74% of respondents said they

CASH  TRANSFERS IN REFUGEE CAMPS
11
would like to receive more training on using 
phones to track expenditures and savings. 
In Za’atari, where 94% of respondents had 
their own phones, 76% said they are able to
use it to track their expenditures and savings, 
and 31% of respondents expressed that they 
would like to receive training on using phones 
to track their expenditures and savings. 
As one woman put it: “[By tracking 
expenditures] I feel a sense of freedom”. In 
the mid-line assessment, all respondents 
expressed interest in more training to 
be 
able 
to 
track 
their 
expenditures. 
They said this would be a ‘good step to 
save and track money’. In addition, 54% 
indicated that the withdrawal of cash on 
a weekly basis has helped in one way 
or another with their decision-making.

Benefits for UN Women and partners
Efficiency and cost reductions
Blockchain 
is 
the 
technology 
behind 
cryptocurrencies 
such 
as 
Bitcoin 
and 
Ethereum. 
These 
encrypted 
digital 
currencies allow transactions to go directly 
to recipients without third parties, making 
money transfers easier, speedier and 
cheaper.7  Oxford University’s independent 
value assessment conclues that a key benefit 
of the UN Women pilot lies in its removal of 
banks as an intermediary, which streamlines 
costs and reconciliation processes.
Prior to the pilot, UN Women relied on UNOPS 
to provide physical cash at the Oases, which 
UN Women staff would then distribute in 
envelopes to its incentive-based volunteers. 
According 
to 
the 
independent 
value 
assessment, this involved much bureaucracy 
and time, as staff had to organize queueing 
times, check IDs and salary amounts, and 
deliver envelopes one at a time.8 Now, that 
process is automated, via iris-scanners at 
the supermarkets. This leaves time for UN 
Women staff to attend to other priorities in 
the camps, significantly reduces overhead 
and administrative costs and bank fees 
and as all transactions are digitized where 
there is a problem in reconciliation this can 
be solved in a matter of hours as opposed 
to days or weeks. 
Improves security and reduces risks
Building 
Blocks 
runs 
on 
a 
private, 
permissioned blockchain using encrypted 
transactions. The fact that UN Women and 
WFP validate each other’s transactions 
through a common blockchain network 
results 
in 
improved 
security 
and 
accountability. The use of digital cash 
payments for humanitarian financing have 
been touted by experts as being more 
secure, while still ensuring privacy.9 WFP 
has stated that through Building Blocks, 
it is better able to protect beneficiary 
data and control financial risks.10 Experts 
say reducing third-party involvement can 
increase security and reduce the risk of 
fraud and of being hacked.11 Storing records 
on a blockchain also makes them essentially 
tamper-proof, thereby reducing the potential 
for misappropriation.12
Greater oversight and effectiveness
Through 
blockchain, 
UN 
Women 
has 
oversight over data from beneficiaries’ digital 
wallets – in particular automated information 
about 
their 
balance 
and 
withdrawls.

Being the custodian of this information 
means that potential disputes and problems 
(for example, if the wrong amount were 
uploaded) can be identified easily and 
resolved quickly and effectively, whereas 
this can be more challenging with an in-
person, manual system. WFP has reported 
that with their blockchain system, any 
issues with transactions can be resolved 
more quickly, offering users a more efficient 
experience.13
Improved insights for humanitarian 
programming
Automatic 
transactional 
data 
on 
how 
beneficiaries 
use 
their 
digital 
wallets 
also gives UN Women new insight into 
their  spending and saving patterns. 
UN Women’s Gender Statistics Analyst 
analysed such spending behaviour by 
location to deliver a trend analysis that 
can 
inform 
future 
programming. 
The 
independent 
value 
assessment 
also 
notes that such information can be put to 
good use, potentially through combined 
analyses with other UN blockchain partners’ 
data, “which might enhance strategic, 
coordinated programming in the camps.”14
Development sector literature emphasizes 
that blockchain technology could facilitate 
data-sharing, help reduce bureaucracy and 
facilitate coordination of actions among 
donors, which all have their own agendas – 
which would also make it easier to identify 
funding gaps in the development aid sector.15
Increased harmonization of aid efforts
The Building Blocks pilot project in Jordan 
represents a major step towards meaningful 
inter-agency collaboration as it marks the 
first time two humanitarian organizations are 
using a common blockchain network while 
using different entitlement management 
systems 
and 
keeping 
their 
internal 
operations intact. This pilot is expected to 
serve as a stepping-stone towards broader 
collaboration 
within 
the 
humanitarian 
cash ecosystem and it paves the way for 
increased harmonization of aid efforts.
To date, most blockchain pilots have involved 
only a single donor or agency. However, 
the real promise of using a blockchain to 
distribute aid is the potential for coordination 
across multiple donors. Sharing information 
across several organizations, including 
donors and partner governments, auditors 
and 
potentially 
even 
beneficiaries 
on a single platform, could make aid 
distribution more efficient in several ways.16 
It could help to prevent unnecessary 
duplication 
of 
effort 
by 
donors 
and 
partner governments; it could promote 
greater 
harmonization 
of 
procedures 
by revealing areas where donors are 
asking 
for 
similar 
information 
from

governments but have different reporting 
standards; and it would allow partner
governments to better integrate aid into 
their budget decisions.17
Beyond 
cash-transfer 
programming, 
blockchain also has the potential to be 
used by humanitarian actors for information 
management, coordination of aid delivery, 
management of crowdfunding, tracking 
supply chains, and boosting humanitarian 
financing.18 Digital cash payments can be 
made interoperable across multiple actors, 
with the possibility of tracking funds from 
original donor to final recipient, while still 
ensuring privacy and security.19
In addition, WFP has stated that the 
blockchain system has allowed it to “set up 
assistance operations more rapidly in the 
wake of emergencies.”20  In fact, blockchain’s 
resilience in the face of emergencies, 
and unexpected disruptions to business-
as-usual, are another benefit and lesson 
learned, to be detailed next in the concrete 
context of COVID-19.

Conclusion 
Through blockchain technology, women 
working at UN Women’s Oasis Centers 
now have the option to either collect cash, 
save or spend it, opening up a new frontier 
of choice and agency for them. The pilot 
initiative has facilitated their access to 
physical cash, seen as a trusted mainstay, 
as well as access to a digital wallet, which is 
viewed as helpful in managing budgets. In 
digitalizing cash delivery, the pilot has given 
refugee participants:
•	
More 
choice 
and 
flexibility, 
by 
enabling them to withdraw any amount 
from their UN Women wallet at a time 
convenient to them, in a convenient 
location at the supermarket.
•	
More regular access to cash, by 
reliably disbursing cash on a weekly 
rather than monthly basis to address 
issues caused by cash shortfalls.
•	
Greater 
financial 
control 
and 
security, as the iris-scan process at 
the supermarket checkout ensures 
that only the owner of the wallet can 
access the cash, rather than husbands 
or children.
•	
Enhanced ability to save, particularly 
for 
emergencies, 
by 
allowing 
beneficiaries to store some or all of 
their salary on the digital wallet for up 
to six months after their work contract 
ends. 
•	
Improved 
digital 
and 
financial 
literacy, through training on how to 
use mobile phones to track spending, 
as well as budgeting seminars.
Moreover, participants report that the 
initiative has helped in their decision-making.
The 
pilot 
has 
also 
had 
important 
organizational benefits, for UN Women and 
WFP, which could also have future positive 
repercussions for Oasis beneficiaries. These 
include:
•	
Greater efficiency and reduced costs, 
by eliminating third parties, making 
money transfers faster and cheaper – 
with significant cost-savings so far for 
UN Women and WFP. 
•	
More 
security 
and 
reduced 
risk, through the use of private, 
permissioned

•	
Enhance oversight and effectiveness, 
allowing UN Women to easily identify 
and resolve potential errors, analyse 
spending patterns and identify trends 
to inform future programming.
•	
Increased 
harmonization 
of 
aid 
efforts, as the first UN collaboration 
involving two organizations using 
a common blockchain network, it is 
expected to pave the way for greater 
interoperability 
and 
collaboration.
Finally, this project has had the unintended 
benefit of illustrating blockchain’s resilience 
during emergencies, as evidenced by UN 
Women’s ability to remotely ensure that cash 
continues to reach beneficiaries despite 
COVID-19 movement restrictions on staff 
and beneficiaries, while the non-contact 
nature of the iris scanning has proven to be 
a safe and hygienic approach.
Based on all of the aforementioned results 
and impacts of the blockchain pilot, in April 
2020, UN Women made the decision to 
scale-up the approach and adopt this cash 
disbursement modality as the new standard 
for all of UN Women’s camp-based Oasis 
cash-transfer programmes, which it was 
able to do as of June 2020. Moving forward 
UN Women will continue to explore with 
WFP opportunities to roll out the approach 
and pilot also in host community settings 
where UN Women in partnership with the 
Ministry of Social Development runs eight 
Oasis centers.
