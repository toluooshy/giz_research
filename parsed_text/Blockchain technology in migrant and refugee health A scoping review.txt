Background The increase of forcibly displaced people worldwide is a challenge for health 
systems and their ability to provide access and equity in Health as a universal right. In 
the case of migrants and refugees, their journey exacerbates this challenge, as they go 
through diverse countries, camps, and humanitarian teams. Hence, the collection and 
analysis of health data are essential in providing quality care. The scientific community 
has been studying health digital technologies to answer health data consolidation, trans­
parency, and global surveillance efficiency issues. Observing some empirical experiments 
with Blockchain in migrants and refugee health, we assessed the state-of-the-art by con­
ducting a literature review.
Methods Blockchain applications are still emerging, which means that peer-reviewed 
literature may still be scarce in life science databases. Therefore, to gather the most ap­
propriate available evidence, we used a diverse and balanced set of databases that com­
pile articles and journals from different fields. We used a multi-step scoping review to 
refine search keywords and analyse the literature. We included studies between 2008 
and 2021 that reported value, utility, or use cases of Blockchain in support of migrant 
and refugee health.
Results We identified a total of 69 articles, with 22 retained for full-text analysis and 8 of 
those being relevant. We employed Rayyan application to manage and evaluate the refer­
ences by two researchers working independently. We identified two main uses of Block­
chain technology to support migrant and refugee health: mitigate the lack of personal 
identification and make health records available. Blockchain also promotes data reliabil­
ity in humanitarian aid, academic certificates, legal contracts, and financial transactions.
Conclusions The availability of reliable information about individuals facilitates univer­
sal health coverage, improves cooperation between diaspora-related countries, and sup­
ports global health efficiency in line with the third goal of the Sustainable Development 
Goals 2030 agenda. Given its characteristics of decentralization, resilience, transparency, 
and auditability, Blockchain remains a promising avenue for future research in migrant 
and refugee health.
Since the World Health Organization (WHO) constitution in 1946, the right to health has 
been increasingly recognized and has gained preponderance in the international agenda [1]. 
On the other hand, according to a 2010 report from the International Organization for Mi­
gration (IOM), international migrants worldwide may be as many as 405 million by 2050 [2]. 
This trend stems from a-significant increase in people’s mobility, fostered by globalization, 
low transportation costs, economic pressures, demographic trends, environmental degrada­
tion, violence, and human rights abuse [2].

Current approaches to managing the health of migrants struggle to keep up with the growing challenges as­
sociated with the complexity, volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of current migration flows. As a result, 
migrants’ fundamental right to health is at risk. The 2010 WHO report calls for the delivery of health services 
to migrants in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner and for capacity building of the health and 
relevant non-health workforces to address key issues such as vaccination [3]. However, collecting, compiling, 
maintaining, assuring quality, analysing health data records and statistics on migrants, refugees, asylum seek­
ers, internally displaced persons, and stateless people remain challenging [3,4]. The same can be said about 
the interpretation of global indicators [5]. The scarcity of reliable data on migration and health, particularly 
about undocumented people, has also been noted by the WHO [6]. It can be a significant reason for the lack 
of understanding of migrants’ and refugees’ health needs [7].
Achieving universal health coverage, including access to quality essential health care services, is a target in the 
third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda [8]. However, according to legal law, identity 
data and authentication are essential to recognize migrants’ existence and for them to exercise rights and ac­
cess services, namely health care. The magnitude and severity of the absence of data on these vulnerable pop­
ulations hinders access to health care services, influencing the achievement of the SDGs [4]. Personal identifi­
cation and inclusion are also a cornerstone of patient-centred medicine.
So far, international guidelines for data collection and analysis have been implemented as an appropriate pro­
cedure for data comparison and to support quality assessment in health systems [9]. This gradual implementa­
tion, progressing from national to international scopes, in a global context, will improve health systems’ capa­
bility to assess the impact of the health policies among different social groups, namely migrants. Nevertheless, 
the Global Consultation on Migrant Health in Madrid, in March 2010, called for the strengthening of informa­
tion systems to collect and disseminate migrant health data, disaggregated by categories, to effectively evaluate 
health indicators while safeguarding ethical issues [10]. Traditionally, such databases are centralized and con­
trolled by a trusted third party who owns the data. However, this approach raises several issues, such as diffi­
cult access to the data by stakeholders (eg, the individual or other health organizations) and low resilience to 
destruction or tampering, namely in case of conflicts or hacking. In 2021, in the M8 Alliance Expert Meetings 
about Digital Solutions for Migrant and Refugee Health [11], we have discussed the potential of Blockchain 
technology to address these concerns. Blockchain, originally introduced in the context of Bitcoin to avoid the 
double-spending of digital money, has been applied to multiple other areas where trust is a key concern [12].
Blockchains are a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that allows data to be securely recorded and 
distributed across a network of peers in different institutions and locations. Adding data to a Blockchain re­
quires a consensus. A transaction is generated and broadcasted for agreement among the peers. After being 
validated, the transaction is added to a pool of unconfirmed transactions. A set of unconfirmed transactions is 
collected into a new block. A consensus algorithm is executed, the new block is added to the Blockchain, and 
the peers are updated. As a result, the records become untamperable, and information can only be added, not 
removed, nor changed [13]. The commonly used Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm requires the peers to 
find the solution to a computationally-intensive puzzle and get rewarded with an amount of the associated to­
ken, or cryptocurrency, and transaction fees [14]. More recent consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake 
(PoS), do not involve computationally intensive operations and thus can reduce power consumption by more 
than 99%. In these cases, processing power is replaced by deposited and locked capital or tokens [14]. Proof-
of-Stake has various advantages, such as better energy efficiency and reduced hardware requirements [15]. 
The decentralization of ledgers helps resolve various issues related to centralized databases, like the need for 
a trusted third party, which is also a single point of failure.
More modern Blockchains also support the storage and enforcement of smart contracts, pieces of comput­
er code that execute automatically when previously agreed-upon terms are fulfilled. This feature can be used 
to automate any process, enhancing transparency, [13] and further promoting trust among participants of a 
transaction in the absence of intermediaries or trusted third parties [16].
Given its development prospects and characteristics of decentralization, resilience, transparency, and auditabil­
ity, Blockchain holds potential for many areas of development, including Fintech, Internet of Things, cloud, 
and health care [17-19]. Some uses of Blockchain in health care, highlighted in the literature, are managing 
hospital overheads or even creating and managing patient medical records, shared and linked to multiple par­
ties, efficiently and transparently [20].
Blockchain technology as a digital solution to support migrant and refugee health is a recent subject in the 
scientific community. It was first mentioned in the extant literature in 2018 in an article that examined Block­
chain applications in migration and diaspora-related initiatives in the context of new digital technologies in 
globalization and transnational spaces [21]. Since then, more articles have been published, and the array of 
use cases has been growing.

Having observed some empirical experiments with the Blockchain in support of migrant and refugee health, 
we decided to perform a literature review to find out the state-of-the-art in the academic literature, which led 
us to the following research question (RQ):
RQ: What is the state-of-the-art in the use of Blockchain in migrant and refugee health?
To answer this RQ, we decided to perform a scoping review, as described in the next section.
METHODS
To provide an overview of the existing literature on the topic of the RQ, we performed a scoping review fol­
lowing the Arksey & O’Malley [22] framework for scoping studies. To identify relevant scientific literature rig­
orously and transparently and ensure consistency in decision-making, we also used guidelines for systematic 
reviews described by Webster & Watson [23] and Kitchenham [24].
We used MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed) and Cochrane Library to cover biomedical and life sciences 
papers, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and AISeL to account for papers focused on engineering and 
technology, and ScienceDirect and Wiley Online Library due to their broad coverage.
The inclusion criteria were conference and journal articles written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. 
We considered papers published after 2008, the year of Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper on Bitcoin, the first success­
ful implementation of Blockchain technology [25]. The search was carried out in June 2021.
We started (Step 1) by searching different combinations of the key­
words “Blockchain”, “Migrants”, “Refugees”, and “Health”, derived from 
the scope of our research. We present the resulting search expressions 
in Table 1. We used minor variations to account for the different user 
interfaces of the various databases.
Searching without strict limitations or restrictions in any field retrieved a total of 659 articles. However, by 
reading the titles and abstracts, we noticed the results were non-specific, and most did not match the subject 
of our study. For example, when the keywords (such as Blockchain) are mentioned in passing among many 
others such as “artificial intelligence,” “Internet-of-Things,” and other contemporary technologies. As noted by 
Arksey & O’Malley [22], the methodology in a scoping study is not a linear process, and each stage should be 
engaged reflexively, and, if needed, some steps may be repeated. Therefore, we added the field tag [Title/Ab­
stract] for added focus on the research question. As a result, we obtained only four articles reporting the use 
of Blockchain to support the health of migrants and refugees, namely proposing the use of this technology to 
address the issues of lack of personal identification and unavailability of health records. These results led us 
to recognize “Identity”, “Electronic Health Records” (EHR), and “Personal Health Records” (PHR) as relevant 
keywords to be used in our search strategy. By experimenting with the search expression, we also noticed that 
the inclusion of the keyword “health” was restricting the results since 13 articles mentioned the use of Block­
chain technology in the context of migrants and refugees, but only two mentioned health. Considering these 
results, we decided to add a second step (Step 2) to our literature review. We removed the keyword “Health” 
and added “Identity”, “EHR”, and “PHR”, leading to the different combinations in Table 2. We maintained the 
same set of databases and inclusion criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the search process with the number of articles 
retrieved and the keywords used at each step.
After reviewing the results, we also searched the grey literature for supporting data, gaps, and possible “new 
frontiers” yet to be discussed in the scientific literature. We found news articles, highlights, and reports on 
websites of international organizations focused on health issues and organizations with on-going data-record­
ing and identification initiatives including Blockchain technology.

RESULTS
We identified a total of 69 articles in both steps of our search: four on Step 1 and sixty-five on Step 2. After 
removing the duplicates on both steps and double-checking after merging the two sets of results, 22 articles 
remained for analysis.
We employed Rayyan QCRI [26] to manage the references. Using this tool, two reviewers independently eval­
uated and classified each article, based on the title and abstract, into one of three categories: 0 – exclude; 1 – 
maybe; 2 – include. We resolved eligibility disagreements among the reviewers in Zoom meetings by presenting 
and discussing the rationales for the assigned classifications. This kind of researcher triangulation is essential 
to increase validity and decrease biases [27,28].
Title and abstract screening excluded 11 articles, and after full-text assessment, we excluded an additional 
three articles. We deemed 14 articles out of scope, and eight remained for further analysis and data extraction. 
Figure 2 describes our literature identification process, oriented by the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for sys­
tematic reviews [29].

The type of study is as reported by the authors or inferred from the study details if not explicit. The articles 
address the issues: lack of identity, humanitarian aid, financial transactions, access to health, academic and 
health records, Covid-19 assistance, and migrant labour exploitation. We organized the issues in columns and 
presented them individually if addressed separately by the authors’ or grouped multiple issues in the same 
column if addressed as interrelated factors. We identified the Blockchain applications and their implications 
for vulnerable populations. Four articles introduced new concepts and proposals for Blockchain applications, 
while others explored running use-cases and their implications on the issues faced by migrants and refugees.
DISCUSSION
Blockchain offers new possibilities for enterprise improvement and public sector management and communi­
cation as a disruptive technology. For example, centralized data logging systems as we know them today can 
move to a distributed system while ensuring no alteration of data and maintaining privacy [20].
Although the available scientific literature on the use of Blockchain in the health care sector has been summa­
rized in previous articles, migrant and refugee health had not been covered yet.
This paper reflects the state-of-the-art of Blockchain applications in support of migrant and refugee health. 
We selected a scoping review with a broader research question, maintaining a comprehensive approach and 
identifying relevant literature regardless of study design to fulfil the absence of articles mapping the research 
activity on this topic.
In the scientific literature, we found two main uses of Blockchain technology in support of migrant and refu­
gee health: addressing the lack of personal identification [21,30-36] and the unavailability of health records 
[30,36]. Additionally, Blockchain is also used to promote data reliability in (migrant) academic certificates 
[18] and legal contracts [31].
The creation of a digital identity stands out as a key Blockchain use in the context of migrant and refugee health, 
as is reported in every article included in our review [21,30-36]. The lack of a legal ID is a barrier to receiving 
health care, even when the migrants and refugees are entitled to it. The security and integrity of the information 
stored in a Blockchain, in this case, identity information, enables migrants and refugees to assert their identity 
and personal information [21,32,33]. Khurshid & Gadnis proposed the use of Blockchain to create a digital 
identity for homeless persons, accessible by health professionals in different cities and countries [36]. Although 
the article refers to the homeless, they are characterized by the authors as a vulnerable population facing iden­
tical challenges to those of migrants and refugees [36]. Shuaib et al. reviewed the applications of Blockchain 
for COVID-19 assistance. They argued that using this technology to create a self-sovereign Blockchain-based 
identity could be very useful to counter or solve the issues of anonymity, accuracy, and personal information 
preservation and control in a pandemic context, ensuring the fundamental rights of undocumented people [30].
Health data availability can also be improved using Blockchain to store electronic health records [30,36]. In­
effective data sharing and poor coordination lead to the duplication of clinical outcomes [7], which in turn 
causes global health costs to rise [36]. The higher availability of health data, enabled by the inherent distribu­
tion of data in a Blockchain, can help mitigate this problem [36].
Limited access to information and support services, namely during the pandemic, has intensified the risk of 
illness in displaced populations, ending in chaotic global health and socioeconomic implications. Using Block­
chain, medical data are uploaded, agreed upon, and automatically distributed to all the stakeholders of a de­
centralized peer-to-peer network (eg, health providers, institutions, NGOs), allowing remote access to health 
data when required. Furthermore, the integration of smart contracts to program medical data sharing between 
the participants prevents communication issues and empowers patients in patient-centred health care in a 
cost-effective, secure, and auditable manner [37]. Besides being untamperable and therefore more reliable, re­
cords stored on a Blockchain are decentralized and under the control of the individuals, who can share them 
with the health care workers assisting them, as illustrated in Figure 3 [30,36]. Migrants and refugees are thus 
provided with resilient and available electronic health records, populated with data resulting from interactions 
with health providers and institutions [30,36], such as previous diagnostics, exams, therapeutics, and even 
vaccination or immunity certificates.
Digital solutions for data recording should include low and medium-income countries like Bangladesh, Dji­
bouti, Ethiopia, Iraq, Ethiopia, and Uganda [4]. The global access and recording of health data in transnational 
spaces improves cooperation between diaspora-related countries and overcomes local limitations of National 
health systems [38].

Despite the challenges in good practices guidelines and health 
policies between countries, global health efficiency should be 
ensured and continuously supported by equity health care 
and good patient experience. This is achieved by health qual­
ity-improvement strategies discussed by global referenced in­
stitutions in line with the third goal of the SDGs 2030 agen­
da [4,8]. At a Health global level, data management can be in 
accordance with health indicators for good practices and new 
health strategies implementation. A large-scale approach for 
severe (eg, oncological pathology) and heterogeneous illness­
es (eg, COVID-19) is a health issue priority related to accurate 
diagnosis and treatment performance [38].
Infectious diseases, namely the rapid spread of the recent 
COVID-19 pandemic, have shown the relevance of validat­
ed data sharing, electronic health record management sys­
tems, and their impact on global health. However, data pro­
tection regulations remain a challenge in terms of data sharing 
[39]. For example, European Union’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) requires care in handling personal data, 
namely because users are entitled to withdraw consent for 
processing and have the right to be forgotten [40]. Similarly, California’s Consumer Privacy Act, a landmark 
law applied since 2018 in the business context, includes the right to delete and opt-out personal information 
[41]. Since information recorded on a Blockchain cannot be removed or changed, using this technology in 
electronic health records is challenging. There are, however, technical and legal solutions to pursue.
Compliance with privacy regulations was studied within a customized architecture design [42]. Rieger et al. 
presented a three-level architecture of Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees Blockchain Solu­
tion as an example of compliance with GDPR, pseudonymizing the data on the Blockchain [42]. It involves 
separating the digital Identity from the digital Blockchain transactions [42]. This type of hybrid solutions, 
where only a minimum amount of data are stored on the Blockchain, can also reduce costs and help mitigate 
concerns about the operation of a Blockchain, namely the supposedly inherent energy consumption and en­
vironmental impact [14].
One concern raised during our presentation in the M8 Alliance Expert Meetings about Digital Solutions for 
Migrant and Refugee Health [11], that is not mentioned in the literature, is the implementation of Blockchain 
in low-resource settings, such as refugee camps. Some existing Blockchains have high operation costs, main­
ly due to the need for expensive hardware and its considerable energy consumption. However, this reality is 
changing. For example, as part of a set of ongoing upgrades, Ethereum, one of the more popular Blockchain 
networks, is moving from a Proof-of-Work to a more energy-conscious Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. 
This change is part of a plan to make the project more scalable, secure, and sustainable, encouraging its adop­
tion [15]. Ethereum has been used in humanitarian aid initiatives, namely the World Food Program’s Build­
ing Blocks [43] and ConsenSys & Moldova’s Blockchain Human Trafficking Project [44]. In the World Food 
Program’s Building Blocks, Blockchain and smart contracts are used to create a digital identity and deliver food 
and financial aid to people in crises, improving transparency, cost-efficiency, and security [32]. In ConsenSys 
and Moldova’s project, Blockchain is also used to create digital identities and expand access to verifiable iden­
tification that can rely on biometric identifiers, including fingerprints and iris scans, which can protect minors 
from trafficking while improving security over personal data [32].
Blockchain can also be used to support migrants and refugees besides health care services [7]. It can be used to 
store and validate academic degrees and certificates [35], which will facilitate job integration at the destination. 
It can be used to promote financial inclusion [21,32] thanks to new services for the traditionally unbanked. It 
can speed up and reduce the costs remittances in developing countries [21] and help engage in online collec­
tive [34] and commercial activities [21]. Additionally, Blockchain-based digital identities can be linked back 
to visas and labour contracts, preventing documentation retention and fraud, protecting migrants and refu­
gees from ill-intentioned employers [31]. Blockchain technology can enable global companies to verify their 
labour supply chains [31]. Employment contract terms are permanently, immutably recorded and accessible, 
thereby enhancing accountability and facilitating auditability [31,45].
This improved supply chain has the potential to turn what was once considered that cheap labour was prefer­
able at any price into a condition on human rights are protected and embedded within all labour services [31].

CONCLUSIONS
Blockchain presents itself as a promising technology with features that can help overcome migrant and refugee 
health gaps and accelerate progress toward Universal Health Coverage. Although Blockchain is used in vari­
ous contexts and sectors that influence the health of migrants and refugees, there are two areas where its im­
portance is highlighted: addressing the lack of personal identification and the unavailability of health records.
Energy consumption concerns and compliance with data protection regulations are viewed as challenges to 
implementing Blockchain but can be potentially overcome with adjusted system designs and consensus mech­
anisms.
Presently, support for the use of Blockchain in health care is mainly empirical, including ad hoc implementa­
tions by companies and other organizations. The scientific literature predominantly comprises articles without 
a defined typology, reviewing and commenting on existing ad hoc implementations. More original research 
articles are needed that study other potential areas of use and allow for a more rigorous assessment of the im­
pact of Blockchain on migrant and refugee health. We conclude that conducting a full systematic review is 
not yet feasible.
However, Blockchain is a promising pathway for future research in migrants’ and refugees’ health.
