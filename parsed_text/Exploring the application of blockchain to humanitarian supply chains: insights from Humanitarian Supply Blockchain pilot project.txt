Abstract
Purpose – Some studies and reports have recently suggested using blockchain technology to improve
transparency and trust in humanitarian supply chains (HSCs). However, evidence-based studies to display the
utility and applicability of blockchains in HSCs are missing in the literature. This paper aims to investigate
the key drivers and barriers of blockchain application to HSCs and explore whether evidence could support that
the application of blockchain improves transparency and trust in HSCs.
Design/methodology/approach – This paper puts forward a two-stage approach to explore the blockchain
application in HSCs: an initial exploration of humanitarian practitioners and academicians interested in
blockchain through focus group discussions; semi-structured interviews with practitioners involved at the UK
Department for International Development’s Humanitarian Supply Blockchain pilot project.
Findings – First, we found that main drivers include accountability, visibility, traceability, trust,
collaboration, time efficiency, reducing administrative work and cross-sector partnership. Main barriers,
however, are composed of engagement issues, lack of technical skills and training, lack of resources, privacy
concerns, regulatory problems, pilot scalability issues and governance challenges. Second, evidence from our
case study revealed the blockchain application could have added value to improve visibility and traceability,
thus contributing to improve transparency. Concerning trust, evidence supports that blockchain could enhance
both commitment and swift trust in the pilot study.
Practical implications – Our study contributes to a more understanding of added values and challenges of
blockchain application to HSCs and creates a perspective for humanitarian decision-makers.
Originality/value – This study provides the first evidence from the actual application of blockchain
technology in HSCs. The study discovered that it is still less evident in many humanitarian organizations,
including medium- and small-sized nongovernmental organizations, that they engage in a direct deployment of
in-house or customized blockchain-based HSC. Instead, these actors are more likely to indirectly use blockchain
in HSCs through a private commercial partner.

1. Introduction
In 2019, humanitarian reports indicated that over 100 million people worldwide were in need
of aid, a number that has increased to nearly 120 million in 2020 (GHA, 2020). The constant
improvement of humanitarian supply chains (HSCs) plays a critical role in addressing such
needs. The HSC refers to the network of humanitarian organizations (HOs), their suppliers
and logistics partners that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the
different processes and activities that produce value in the form of supplies, cash and/or
services in the hands of the affected communities (Kovacs and Spens, 2009).
To live up to the challenges posed by this level of scale up, HSCs must first overcome its
current limitations. Recent studies show that HSCs still suffer from a lack of transparency
and issues with trust which has led to duplicated efforts and operations deficiencies (Besiou
and Van Wassenhove, 2020). SC transparency refers to reporting to and communicating with
stakeholders to provide traceability regarding the history of the products and visibility about
current activities throughout the SC (Morgan et al., 2018). Traceability is the ability of an SC to
indicate the current or historical state of activities associated with a product. Visibility refers
to the extent that SC partners have access to quality information about various aspects of
demands and supplies (Maghsoudi and Pazirandeh, 2016). Trust in SC is defined as the
willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence (Tejbal et al., 2013).
While HOs are under increasing pressure for enhancing traceability of relief items, donors
and governments have repeatedly asked to see tangible results and called for improved
information exchange between humanitarian stakeholders. Moreover, the lack of trust in
HSCs hampers effective disaster relief operations and can result in disallowance of funding
from donors, and complex audit procedures (Piotrowicz, 2018). The lack of trust and
transparency has also been cited frequently in the literature as main an obstacle for effective
collaboration among humanitarian actors in disasters response (Moshtari, 2016).
Research in the operations and SC management literature suggests that distributed ledger
technology (DLT) and specifically blockchain hold the promise to improve transparency and
smoothen up trade within trust-less environments (Cole et al., 2019; Queiroz and Wamba,
2019; Babich and Hilary, 2020). DLT has established itself as an umbrella term to designate
multiparty systems that operate in an environment with no central operator or authority,
despite parties who may be unreliable or malicious. Blockchain technology is often
considered a specific subset of the broader DLT universe that uses a particular data structure
consisting of a chain of hash-linked blocks of data (Rauchs et al., 2018). Blockchain refers to a
shared distributed ledger where transactions are digitally recorded and linked in a chain
containing the entire history or provenance of an asset. A transaction is recorded on the
blockchain only after it has been validated using a consensus protocol, and each record is
encrypted to provide an extra layer of security.
In the context of HSCs, some studies have suggested different drivers for blockchain
adoption such as improving visibility and accountability (Ozdemir et al., 2021); enhancing
swift trust, collaboration and resilience (Dubey et al., 2020); leveraging partnership with
logistics service providers (Baharmand and Comes, 2019) and facilitating resource sharing
(L’Hermitte and Nair, 2020). Moreover, some studies have proposed combining the blockchain
with Internet of things (Khan et al., 2021) or with artificial intelligence and 3D printing
(Rodrıguez-Espındola et al., 2020) to further enhance HSC performance. However, first,
empirical research on the application of the blockchain in HSC that combine multiple methods
to derive practical insights is scant in the literature (Dubey et al., 2020). Second, as we explain
in detail in Section 2, available research on the drivers and barriers of blockchain adoption to
HSC has often been informed by studies in the commercial settings without considering
differences between humanitarian and commercial SCs (Kovacs and Spens, 2009). We
acknowledge that one reason could be the limited available information about the (very few)
blockchain projects in HSCs. Nevertheless, Ozdemir et al. (2021) and Wamba (2020) contend

that without real-world evidence, it is challenging to validate blockchain’s contributions to
address HSC challenges. Similarly, by solely relying on conceptual frameworks, it would be
difficult for practice to realize implementation challenges and identify mitigation or solution
strategies. There is a need for evidence-based studies on the blockchain application to HSCs
that explore added values and challenges from real-world projects.
In this paper, we aim to address the gap through an evidence-based study. We pose the
following research questions: (RQ1) what are the key drivers and barriers of blockchain
application in the HSC? and (RQ2) could evidence support that the application of blockchain
improves transparency and trust in HSCs? Methodologically, we leverage insights from the
scant HSC literature that has conceptually investigated drivers and barriers of blockchain
adoption in (e.g. Sahebi et al., 2020; Khadke and Parkhi, 2020; Patil et al., 2021) to inform our
multi-method study: focus group discussions combined with an in-depth case study of the
Humanitarian Supply Blockchain pilot. To the best of our knowledge, the Humanitarian
Supply Blockchain pilot is the only humanitarian blockchain pilot project that (1) has targeted
the scope of delivering relief items to affected communities (opposed to other pilots that focus
on cash-based assistance), and (2) its existence is known through public information
platforms (e.g. medium.com) and the researchers’ own network. Our study contributes to the
ongoing discussion in the humanitarian operations and SC management literature about the
added value and challenges of blockchain application to HSC (Wamba, 2020) by providing
evidence from a real-world project in the humanitarian context.
To address the research questions, this study builds on the contingent resource-based
view (RBV) of the firm (Brush and Artz, 1999). HSC research has applied RBV frequently to
explain dynamic SC capabilities such as trust and transparency (e.g. Altay et al., 2018). In our
research, the contingent RBV helps us to understand how blockchain application can
improve the supply chain trust and transparency given that they are contingent and
contextual to certain challenges and barriers based on evidence from real projects.
The rest of our paper is organized as follows: In the next section, an overview of the related
background is provided. The methodology is presented in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates
findings from focus group discussion and case study of the Humanitarian Supply Blockchain
pilot project. In Section 5, the cross-method findings, the implications and limitations of the
study are discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with the future research in Section 6.
2. The research background
2.1 Shortcomings of current information systems in HSCs
There are often two types of technology-supported information systems (IS) in HSCs. The
first category aims at providing specific decision and management support functions, such as
routing and navigation, inventory management and facility location or distribution planning.
The second category, however, targets providing documentation, monitoring and tracking
functionalities to improve different SC capabilities such as transparency, accountability,
information sharing and cost efficiency (Van de Walle and Comes, 2015).
Systems in the second category (the scope of our paper) provide dedicated information on
the location and use of specific goods, often in near real time, enabling analysis of patterns
and detection of outliers or risks. However, as advanced as they might be, these systems
typically lack integration in the overall planning, logistics decision-making and coordination
processes as well as specific quality management and control functions. Van de Walle and
Comes (2015) contend that the IS in HSC often fail to provide effective, end-to-end visibility
and traceability. Delivering humanitarian relief through HSCs is often conducted by a large
variety of HOs, agencies and actors, each using their own systems, data sets and processes.
Such a working environment leaves the HSC fragmented and opaque (Besiou and Van
Wassenhove, 2020). The shortcoming of current IS with respect to traceability and visibility

has made HSCs prone to operational risks such as waste of relief items, duplicated efforts and
corruption (Rodrıguez-Espındola et al., 2020).
Moreover, existing IS at HSCs have not effectively addressed trust-related issues between
actors specifically in the context of humanitarian disasters response. According to several
reports, the mistrust problem hampered effective collaboration among HOs to reach
beneficiaries in severely affected but remote locations in the aftermath of 2015 Nepal
earthquake. Lack of collaboration resulted in duplicated relief delivery in urban areas, while
some beneficiaries in remote areas had to wait a long time to receive humanitarian aid. On the
other hand, the increasing privacy concerns related to both responders and beneficiaries
often prevent enhancing information sharing among HSC actors (e.g. patient data in the
Ebola response or the location of schools, camps, hospitals in the Syria crisis). Kovacs and
Spens (2009) emphasize that HSCs are quickly formed in disasters response, and slow
information flow results in major hindrance for trust among the responding agencies. Indeed,
DLTs and more specifically blockchain technology might allegedly mitigate such
information-sharing challenges and provide further support to enhance visibility,
traceability and trust along supply chains (Kshetri, 2018; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018;
Cole et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Queiroz et al., 2020).
2.2 The blockchain and smart contracts
Blockchains have four main characteristics that make them interesting for the context of SC
management. First, as the blockchain is designed to be distributed and synchronized across
networks, it encourages involved parties to share data and is therefore ideal for
multiorganizational trade networks such as SCs. Second, the blockchain is built using
peer-to-peer networks, whereby there must be agreement between all relevant parties that a
transaction is valid, which serves to keep inaccurate or potentially fraudulent transactions
out of the database. Third, immutability of the data means that agreed transactions are
recorded and not altered. This provides security on provenance of assets, which means that
for any asset, it is possible to tell where it is, where it has been and what has happened
throughout its lifetime (Cole et al., 2019; Babich and Hilary, 2020).
Fourth, some blockchains support smart contracts. Despite its name, a smart contract is
not a legally binding agreement enforceable by law but a computer protocol or a trusted
application that is installed on the nodes of the blockchain (Chang et al., 2019). The smart
contract is intended to digitally facilitate, verify or enforce the negotiated terms of a contract –
allowing for credible transactions without the need for third-party interventions as they are
automated. These specific protocols can decide whether a specific operation, such as a given
payment, should be permitted or not. Compared to traditional contracts, smart contracts have
the advantages of diminishing risk, cutting down administration and service costs and
improving the efficiency of business processes (Babich and Hilary, 2020). More importantly,
smart contracts have the capacity to create trust between parties in what we term no-trust or
trust-less contracting environments (Baharmand and Comes, 2019).
Blockchains are categorized into public versus private blockchains (based on who is
allowed to join) as well as permissioned versus permission-less (based on who is allowed to
write on the blockchain). Unlike public blockchains that are completely open for anyone to
join, private blockchains require an invitation, and participants must be validated. According
to Lim et al. (2021), private and permissioned blockchains are more favorable for SCs than
permission-less public blockchains as private blockchains can provide security, timeliness
and transparency to all its users. Moreover, permissioned blockchains are a more viable
option for centrally governed SCs because such blockchains are restricted to known parties
who would have limited access to certain data segments only. According to Kouhizadeh and
Sarkis (2018), current SC actors are unlikely to accept public permission-less blockchains

because revealing proprietary details such as demand, capacities, orders, prices and margins
at all points of the value chain to unknown participants would be unwise.
2.3 Blockchain and smart contracts applications in SC management
Recent surveys show that there is a growing interest on the application of blockchain in the
context of operations and SC management (e.g. Lim et al., 2021). Queiroz et al. (2020) review
blockchain-related journal papers and conclude that SC scholars have found blockchain
contributions as enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management;
reducing illegal counterfeiting; improving sustainable SC management; advancing inventory
management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new
product design and development and improving SC efficiency.
Quiroz and Wamba (2019) suggest that blockchain can speed up information flow
(document workflow management), financial transactions through data confidentiality, and
improve coordination through device connectivity among SC actors. Wang et al. (2019)
contend that blockchain also offers increased supply chain integration, which leads to a better
overall supply chain performance. Kshetri (2018) argues that the blockchain-based SC leads
to increased customer confidence by providing them the benefits of real-time tracking of the
products, reduction in product movement costs, highly secured transactions and protect
product counterfeiting. Kouhizadeh and Sarkis (2018) contend that the transparency,
visibility and security attributes of blockchains build trust in commercial SCs and can
eliminate or at least expose any hidden unethical behaviors by certain SC actors. In summary,
the promise of blockchain for SC management is to provide significant improvement with
respect to visibility, accountability, traceability and trustworthy relationship.
Several papers in the literature have referred to smart contracts as either the most
transformative blockchain application for SCs or the highly targeted area for further
exploration (e.g. Prause and Boevsky, 2019). Hasan et al. (2019) highlight that smart contracts
are becoming a desired functionality due to their flexibility and power to include business
logic under certain conditions, thus removing costs and time from the supply chain via self-
execution. In summary, smart contracts have been suggested in several contexts for
increasing transparency and trust (Chang et al., 2019); monitoring products and automating
the tracking and clearance processes (Cole et al., 2019); improving quality management and
demand–supply management (Kshetri, 2018); reducing intermediaries, transaction costs and
time (Prashar et al., 2020); and managing shipment conditions while automating payments
(Prause and Boevsky, 2019). However, the application of blockchain and smart contracts in
the context of HSC has been rarely discussed (Baharmand and Comes, 2019).
2.4 Blockchain applications in the humanitarian setting
HOs typically work in low-technology environments, where they have to deal with complex
crisis while relying on limited resources. These are mostly generated from financial support
from institutional donors and sometimes private donations and bound to programming needs
instead of their information technology architecture. As a result, most HOs have limited
resources and capacity for investment in technology infrastructure. Once humanitarian
digital systems are built, they tend to be maintained for long periods of time with little further
development or evolution. Overall, enterprise humanitarian systems tend to change slowly,
are rarely state of the art, suffer from a litany of technical issues and are organization-specific
with limited interoperability (Blakstad et al., 2020). While it is unrealistic to distinguish an
inherently humanitarian blockchain given the interdependencies and overlapping with
commercial and public sectors (Coppi and Fast, 2019), emerging research is framing specific
design frameworks to ensure that such systems are at least compatible with humanitarian
applications (Baharmand et al., 2021).

Since 2017, several organizations have been testing these assumptions in a variety of fields,
including cash-based assistance, auditability, identity services, community currencies, donor
engagement, innovative financing and funding. The first use case is possibly the richest in
concrete examples, including Mercy Corps’ partnership with The Blockchain Charity Foundation
by Binance, Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash transfer program in Vanuatu (Blakstad et al., 2020) or
Sikka by World Vision International in Nepal (Coppi and Fast, 2019). Given that most instances
steer clear from sending transactions through the blockchain, often the line between cash-based
assistance and audit-oriented use cases is extremely blurry, as in the case of World Food
Programme’s Building Blocks pilot project. On the other side of the spectrum sits the field of SC
management, which has seen almost no purely humanitarian application advancing beyond
proof of concept or early pilot stage.
2.5 Drivers and barriers for blockchain applications in HSCs
Research on blockchain in HSC is relatively new, and to the best of our knowledge, it has
mainly focused on the drivers and barriers of adopting blockchain in HSCs. For drivers, HSC
scholars have elaborated on the potential of blockchain to address the shortcomings of
second category of IS in HSCs (cf. Section 2.1). The available research often refers to the
motives such as improving collaboration (Dubey et al., 2021), increasing transparency,
accountability and security (Seyedsayamdost and Vanderwal, 2020), building higher levels of
trust (Demir et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2020), removing intermediaries and enhancing
coordination (Khan et al., 2021), improving cost efficiency and traceability (Khadke and
Parkhi, 2020) and leveraging partnerships with third-party logistics service providers
(Baharmand and Comes, 2019). However, much of research on this topic has remained
conceptual. Sahebi et al. (2020) postulate that what blockchain can do to improve the HSC is
yet to be backed by reliable evidence from real-world projects in the field.
Opposed to drivers, barriers to blockchain adoption in HSCs have been empirically
investigated in some studies (Baharmand and Comes, 2019; Coppi and Fast, 2019; Khadke and
Parkhi, 2020; Sahebi et al., 2020; Coppi, 2020; Patil et al., 2021). Baharmand and Comes (2019)
refer to financial slacks, top management support, organizational compatibility, technology
readiness, technology complexity, infrastructure, technology compatibility, legislation, the few
early adopters and cross-sector partnership as mainbarriers. Coppi and Fast(2019) mention the
lack of good understanding among HOs regarding what blockchain is, how it can be designed
and for what purposes it can be used beyond the hype. Sahebi et al. (2020) recognize the lack of
knowledge and employee training, high sustainability costs, the lack of successful validations,
integration challenges with existing legacy systems and scalability issues. Coppi (2020)
highlights barriers such as the low access to human and technological resources, low level of
engagement, lack of governance models, lack of standardization and implementation issues in
the downstream part. Patil et al. (2021) identify data privacy, ownership and security issues;
funding issues and cost complexity and technological complexities as the most significant
barriers. The study also refers tothelackofawareness and understandingamongstakeholders,
and interoperability, collaboration and cross-pollination among HOs as the least influential
barriers to blockchain adoption in HSCs. A summary of drivers and barriers to blockchain
adoption in SCs derived from previous studies is provided in Appendix 1.
2.6 Research gap
Our review has two main findings. First, our review confirms Wamba’s (2020) study that
empirical research with a focus on blockchain and HSCs is scant. In fact, the few available
research conceptually discusses blockchain in HSCs concentrating on technology adoption
theories. This outcome is in line with the findings of recent, broader surveys (e.g. Wang et al.,
2019; Gurtu and Johny, 2019; Queiroz et al. 2020) that case studies concerning the added value

--- Page 7 ---
of blockchains in the context of SCs are scarce. There is a need for evidence-based studies to
investigate added values and challenges of blockchain application in HSCs. To this end,
Dubey et al. (2020) call for mixed-methods research including single or multiple case studies,
as the use of a single method may not provide complete insights.
Second, our review reveals that in the absence of evidence from real-world projects in
humanitarian contexts to support the arguments, drivers and barriers for blockchain
adoption in the HSC are often echoed from extensive research on commercial SCs. In practice,
IS for HSC are typically designed and applied upon technology that has been initially
developed for the commercial sector. As such, relying solely on insights from commercial SC
regarding the drivers and barriers of blockchain adoption in HSCs can be misleading. This is
mainly due to the critical differences between commercial and HSCs (Baharmand et al., 2021).
Without evidence, there is a risk of HOs rushing to use the technology, harnessing it in the
wrong way or for the wrong reasons, and being disappointed with the results. Our paper aims
to address these two gaps through an evidence-based study combining multiple methods.
3. Methodology
For the purpose of our study, we combined multiple methods. The rationale for combining
methods is to make sure they complement each other and build upon each other. Inspired by
van Hoek’s (2019) research, we structured our research into two stages: an initial exploration
using a focus group and further exploration using a case study. Figure 1 illustrates the overall
research methodology of paper.
3.1 Initial exploration: the focus group
A focus group was organized with 21 participants (six scholars [S1-6] and 15 practitioners
[P1-15]) interested in the application of distributed ledger technologies in the humanitarian
sector. The practitioners were from different organizations, including international
nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) (four), small NGOs (two), UN agencies (seven) and
business partners (two). The focus group members were identified based on their
participation at a digital paper presentation session at the Health and Humanitarian
Logistics 2020 conference on September 30, 2020. The paper was about using distributed
ledger technologies for supplying food in humanitarian contexts (Lechner et al., 2020). The
participants were invited to a Zoom meeting after the paper presentation session.

Theobjectiveofthemeetingwastoexploreconsiderationsfortheapplicationofblockchainin
HSCs through a digital workshop. As of preparation for the workshop (cf. Section 2.2), we asked
participants to rate therelevance of literature-derived barriersanddrivers(cf. Table 1) to provide
a basis for the discussion. The questionnaire used a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1
“strongly unimportant” to 7 “strongly important”. We used some of the aggregated findings (cf.
Section 4.1) to drive constructive discussion during the focus group work session. Moreover, we
included open text to identify any missing barrier or driver. If a missing barrier or driver was
mentioned, we asked the corresponding participant to elaborate on the point in a separate form.
Given the number of participants and questions that we wanted to explore in the focus
group discussions (see focus group protocol in Appendix 4), we used the subgroup function
supported by the digital meeting means that we used. We divided the focus group
participants into four subgroups (one group had six members) and allowed internal
discussions in subgroups before providing space for groups to present their viewpoints in

Greater accountability
The system showed potential to improve accountability
through access to accurate information about who has
responsibility for shipments, and how can this information
be trusted. The system offered traceable accountability.
All actors could see the current step of the shipment.
Handover documentation was cryptographically valid.
Transfer of ownership was transparent, so, for instance,
we could see who was responsible for the shipment of
which pint in time
18
Greater visibility
The technology provided accurate status reports on the
provenance, use-by-dates, location and transfer of
products. It was simple to see who has goods at any time.
We tested a scenario where each agency could update a
shipment’s status, while everyone in the chain was able to
check or verify what is happening to it without using
middlemen
14
Greater traceability
The blockchain network gave controlled access to
information, allowed different permissions for those
accessing supply chain data as needed. It also removed the
need for separate reconciliation procedures among
different participants that could demand verification. This
greater traceability in a broader perspective could reduce
opportunities for fraud and theft
13
Trust
[Commitment trust:] Our aim was to empower the users to
have as much control of the most critical parts of the
supply chain as possible. This was partly to ensure trust in
the system and partly to communicate clearly to the user
exactly what information comes onto the blockchain [. . .].
We could observe that real-time information about
custodianship and accountability improved trust for key
actors in the supply chain
[Swift trust:] The system increased user trust with a
transparent tamper-resilient system for recording
consignment and handovers as well as geolocation data
11
Reduced administrative costs and
improved time efficiency
The smart contracts protocol over the blockchain helped to
complete at the necessary stages within the supply chain. I
can envision that in a scaled application the blockchain
could reduce administrative costs, save time and minimize
the risk of disputes

all-groups discussions. To ensure effective discussions inside subgroups, we tried to have a
balanced composition of expertise and experience in each group as far as possible.
The discussions during focus group sessions were considered sufficient as we achieved
theoretical saturation: The participants’ opinions converged, and we concluded that further
discussions would not bring incremental benefit to the theory (Rowlands et al., 2016).
3.2 Further exploration: the case study
To capture a more complete, holistic and contextual understanding of how blockchain can be
applied to the HSC, we used the qualitative case study methodology and followed Vega’s
(2018) framework. Case study research has been frequently recommended in the HSC
literature. It is considered a powerful method to explore real-world examples (Vega, 2018) and
bridge the gap between HSC research and practice (Kovacs and Moshtari, 2019). Yin (2018)
refers to the case study as an empirical inquiry investigating a contemporary phenomenon in
depth and within its real-life context.
Vega’s (2018) framework contains four stages. First, the “why” stage concerns defining
the case study’s purpose explicitly. As mentioned before, our purpose is to capture a better
understanding of applying blockchain in the HSC.
Second, the “what” stage relates to the contextualization of the research method
explaining the unit of analysis, including the organization, project and country. For our
research, we used the Humanitarian Supply Blockchain pilot project (thereafter referred to as
“pilot”) as the case. The project consists of building a blockchain-based system to track a
sample shipment of plastic sheeting shelter kits from an offshore warehouse in Pakistan
through multiple logistics service providers to Dubai where they are assumed to be needed.
The pilot was jointly launched by Palladium (a social enterprise), Datarella (a private
software company), NRS Relief (a supplier in the HSC) and DFID (a donor). We acknowledge
the limitations of the pilot as issues for warehousing and eventually dispatch to areas in need
(i.e. last-mile distribution) were not involved. We elaborate on such limitations in Section 5.3.
Third, the “how practically” stage presents the rationale for selecting the case as well as
techniques for data collection and analysis. Our rationale was twofold: (1) To the best of our
knowledge, the selected project has been among the very few pilots for using blockchain in
the HSC that has passed the concept phase; (2) despite its limited scope, the pilot provided
baseline evidence about how blockchain can be utilized in multi-stakeholder HSCs.
The data for this case study were collected via 10 semi-structured interviews involving
senior-level managers and technical experts (details of interviews are given in Appendix 4).
The interviews were conducted anonymously to encourage honesty and candid perspectives.
We used Skype, and all interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and sent back to
participants for potential comments. Each of the discussions lasted between 30 and 50 min
and was loosely guided by an interview protocol with four questions (cf. Appendix 4).
Departures from each conversation’s agenda were permitted in the interest of exploring new
and potentially fruitful points. To ensure triangulation among various points of view (Yin,
2018) and reduce subjectivity, we asked interviewees the same question to determine whether
and to what degree their responses were in agreement. The discussions’ format was adapted
and changed slightly from one discussion to the next to pursue exciting and particularly
relevant new facets of the case study as they emerged. Finally, following Yin (2018),
particularly relevant quotations were extracted from the interviews and presented in
Appendix 4. The small sample size for the interviews conducted relates to the small scale of
the pilot project; we could find only a limited number of relevant experts. However, within 10
interviews with key actors, we achieved theoretical saturation and concluded that further
interviews would not bring incremental benefit to the theory (Rowlands et al., 2016).
Fourth, the “how conceptually” stage relates to the extent to which the case is built and
discussed concerning theory. We discuss our case study findings in Section 5. In Appendix 5,

we provide details on how we used leveraging screens in our research for conducting a
rigorous case study research. We followed Elo et al.’s (2014) checklist for trustworthiness.
4. Findings from the focus group
As explained in Section 3.2, we first asked the focus group to rate the relevance of drivers and
barriers using a seven-point Likert scale. Figures 2a and b show average scores for drivers
and barriers calculated based on the responses. We used the figures to stimulate discussions
during the focus group work session.
Figure 2a depicts that visibility received the highest score among main drivers. This result
is compatible with findings from other research that stress the potential of blockchain for
improving visibility in SCs in general (e.g. Prashar et al., 2020). In the context of HSCs, the
result can be partly related to the fact that HOs have been under mounting scrutiny in recent
years to increase visibility over their SCs (Besiou and Van Wassenhove, 2020). Meanwhile,
pressure from donors and/or other actors ranked lowest. In fact, HOs are often not subject to
the peer pressure from their competitors as of what commercial companies often face in the
business sector (van Hoek, 2019).
Figure 2a also shows motives to improve accountability, traceability and trust among the
top-five-ranked drivers. Interestingly, these drivers relate to the critical challenges of IS in
HSCs as described in Section 2.1. Moreover, questionnaire results do support enhancing
cross-sector partnership and collaboration as relatively important driver for applying
blockchain technology to HSCs. The importance of blockchain to facilitate trade and
collaboration in SCs in trust-less environments has been notably discussed in the commercial
literature (e.g. Wang et al., 2019). The fact that this driver received a relatively lower score
compared to the top-five drivers could refer to the lack of experience in the field regarding the
added value of blockchain in the HSCs, as noted by Coppi and Fast (2019).
Figure 2b shows the average scores for barriers (and challenges) of applying blockchain to
HSCs. We acknowledge that respondents found all barriers to be quite important as the
minimum average score (3.2) depicted (also referring to the fact that the difference between
minimum and maximum scores is not huge). The three highly scored challenges referred to the
limited resources at HOs to apply the technology, costs-related issues and privacy concerns.
Moreover, the results confirm the relative importance of change management issues and
engagement problems as other impeding factors as noted by Coppi (2020). Another important
observation from Figure 2b is that respondents recognized integration issues (including
management support) among the least important barriers. This is opposed to Baharmand and
Comes’s (2019) findings and probably reflects the shift in HOs top management levels toward
exploring new technologies and approaches to address HSC challenges (Zwitter and Bosse-
Despiaux, 2018). Another potential reason could be that management is eager to offer support
to pilots when they are grant driven, however, same support might stall when it is the time for
real integration, as proven by the fact that very few blockchain pilot projects in the
humanitarian sector has moved beyond that stage (Coppi and Fast, 2019).
Interestingly, the barrier “complexity of implementation in downstream” received the
lowest score from the list of barriers in the questionnaire. As we discussed this outcome in the
focus group, some participants suggested that the divergence could relate to the shortage of
public evidence regarding lessons learned and challenges faced in humanitarian blockchain
projects. We will show later in Section 5 that, at least in our case study, complexity of
implementation in downstream was among the most important challenges that actors faced.
Surprisingly, the technology itself attracted a fair share of criticism in our focus group
discussions despite participants noted the potential utility of blockchain to address HSC
issues. The technology complexity has been noted in the literature as a main barrier (Sahebi
et al., 2020). This can probably explain why barriers for applying blockchain to HSCs received

relatively higher scores than drivers in the questionnaire results (compare Figures 2a and b).
As some participants highlighted, HOs, like most large bureaucracies, tend to be risk-averse
and slow to innovate. Therefore, HOs are afraid to struggle in overcoming concerns about
governance and operational resilience when shifting from legacy systems to a blockchain-
based network. Some participants argue that there are currently no real incentives for HOs –
especially large HOs – to abandon legacy systems.
Furthermore, an interesting barrier emerged from the open text of the questionnaire and
the third discussion round in the focus group (cf. Appendix 4). We name the barrier
“unfamiliarity with the blockchain”. This is in line with Coppi and Fast’s (2019) study that
refers to a “lack of good understanding among HOs regarding what blockchain is, how it can
be designed, and for what purposes it can be used beyond the hype”. In our study, different
respondents referred to the lack of understanding through distinct constructs such as (1) lack
of understanding about blockchain requirements, (2) ambiguities about the blockchain
design and (3) unfamiliarity about potential benefits. Our respondents did not converge to
any concrete score for this barrier; however, they agreed that the impact can be high.
5. Findings from the case study
In this section, we elaborate on the evidence concerning the added values and challenges of
blockchain application in HSCs derived from the case study. The information about the scope
and context of the case study is provided in Appendix 3. Interview protocol and interviewees
details (I1–I11) are given in Appendix 4.
Table 1 presents the evidence samples from our interviews concerning the added value of
blockchain application to HSCs. The added values are ordered based on the frequency that
our interviewees referred to them in conversations. The frequency of reference has been used
in our study as a measure to roughly assess the importance of factors.
As Table 1 depicts, enhanced accountability was the frequent added value that interviewees
mentioned for the HSC blockchain pilot. This is in line with the goals that project stakeholders
set in the beginning of the pilot, according to the pilot’s report (DFID, 2019). Trust was the
fourth frequently mentioned construct in our interviews. However, we should note that the
frequency of trust presented in Table 1 refers to a mix of evidence regarding the commitment
trust (8) and swift trust (4). While commitment trust is based on contractual agreements, rules,
processes and procedures between the parties, swift trust often occurs in temporary teams
based on contextual cues. Apart from improved visibility, traceability and trust, increased time
and cost efficiency were also mentioned rather frequently in interviews. The latter was due to
the capability of implemented blockchain-based smart contracts to eliminate paper-work and
administrative delays. Our case study findings regarding the contribution of blockchain
application to HSCs supports focus group discussions about drivers. Accountability, visibility
and trust were among the keywords of the top five highly ranked drivers (cf. Figure 2a).
We found evidence for other added values of blockchain applications to the HSC in our
interviewees as well, although their repetition frequencies were lower than five times, such as
improved collaboration (four times) or reduced opportunities for fraud and theft (two times).
Interviewees from DFID collectively referred to observations for decreased shrinkage and
better collaboration opportunities. An interviewee (I6) referred to the main success factor of
the project as the fact that three separate organizations could work on the same tracking
system simultaneously. Moreover, two interviewees stressed the enhancements concerning
the material flow. One interviewee referred to the smooth movement of items and mentioned
that “the shipment flowed like expected, the last handover was frictionless, and all goods arrived
safely (I5)”. Surprisingly, we found no evidence from interviews that could support focus
group discussions regarding the contribution of blockchain to improve security and to reduce
lead times in HSCs (cf. Figure 2a).

--- Page 14 ---
Although most interviewees referred to the pilot as a success (e.g. “the pilot demonstrated a
successful trial of the technology (I1)”), all of them agreed that the exploration was not
challenge free. Interestingly, we found that the number and the frequency of mentioned
challenges were more than similar figures for added values. The three top frequently repeated
challenges in interviews were low engagement level (14 times), lack of technical skills and
training (14 times) and various issues with downstream implementation (13 times). For
detecting other important challenges of blockchain application to HSC in the pilot, we used a
threshold of minimum five-time repetition frequency in interviews. The identified important
challenges include integration issues, lack of resources, privacy concerns, regulatory
problems, governance issues and data accuracy problems. Details about the evidence that
support challenges are provided in Appendix 4.
Interestingly, case study findings about challenges and focus group findings about
barriers support each other to some extent. Highly ranked barriers in the focus group
discussions such as lack of resources, privacy concerns and engagement issues were
identified as important challenges in the pilot project, too. However, there are two important
divergences between findings from the two methods. First, issues with downstream
implementation (one of the top four challenges that practitioners experienced in the pilot) is
the lowest ranked barrier discussed in the focus group discussions (complexity of
downstream implementation). Moreover, the barriers financial slacks and change
management issues (the second- and fourth-ranked barriers in focus group discussions,
respectively) were not among the identified challenges in the pilot project at all. Although the
specific reasons are unclear, this could eventually be a consequence of the small scale of the
pilot project. We discuss some of the discrepancies between findings in Section 6 and explain
the rest of them in Appendix 6.
We found evidence about some less frequently mentioned challenges in interviews that
have also been rarely noted in the literature about blockchain in SCs. They were issues related
to interoperability, intellectual property and trade-offs between features of the envisioned
system. We explain these barriers in Appendix 4.
6. Discussion and implications to theory and practice
In this section, we first answer our RQs while discussing the cross-method findings. Then, we
elaborate on the theoretical contributions of the research. Thereafter, we explain the
implications for practice and limitations of our study.
6.1 Discussion on cross-method findings
RQ1. What are the key drivers and barriers of blockchain application in the HSC?
We discuss cross-method findings starting with the first RQ regarding the main drivers and
barriers of blockchain application to HSCs. Main drivers include accountability, visibility,
traceability, trust, collaboration, time efficiency, reducing administrative work and cross-
sector partnership. Main barriers, however, are composed of engagement issues, lack of
technical skills and training, lack of resources, privacy concerns, regulatory problems, pilot
scalability issues and governance challenges. We selected main drivers and barriers from
those factors that were tagged as important in both focus group findings and case study
findings. When we observed any discrepancy between the importance level between focus
group and case study findings, we prioritized case study findings. Our rationale refers to the
evidence from the real-world project that could support the case study findings. Detailed
descriptions of discrepancies are provided in Appendix 6.

For drivers, cross-method analysis shows that the top main drivers could be accountability,
visibility, traceability, trust and collaboration although they should not be considered as
equally important. The list of main drivers is in line with a few available research in HSC
literature that have discussed drivers for blockchain adoption in HSC. For instance, Rodrıguez-
Espındola et al. (2020) suggest blockchain to resolve the lack of accountability in the HSC, and
Dubey et al. (2020) refer to drives to improve trust and collaboration in the HSC. The different
significance of drivers was evident when we compared focus group and case study findings.
For instance, the drive to “improve visibility” received the highest average score among all
drivers for blockchain application to HSC in our focus group discussions, while it was the
second frequently construct in our interviews. Based on insights that we received from
participants and interviewees, we think that the importance of drivers could be context-
dependent (e.g. size of HO, target locations of HO, target cluster of HO, etc.).
Moreover, there are some literature-derived motives that either (1) were ranked of moderate or
low importance in findings from both methods or (2) we could not validate in our study.
Regarding (1) we specifically highlight the driver to enhance cross-sector partnership (moderate
score). Previous studies have referred to this motive as an important driver (e.g. Baharmand and
Comes, 2019). This holds true for drivers “reduce administrative work” and “time efficiency”.
Since these drivers have been cited in the literature and we found some evidence in our findings to
support their moderate importance level, we added them to the list of main drivers.
Concerning barriers, an interesting observation is that “engagement issues” was found by
our interviewees as one of the main challenges of the pilot project. Meanwhile, we found that
collaboration was among the important drivers of blockchain application to HSCs. SC
collaboration is the capability to define a problem, to make joint decisions, to properly assign
key roles and responsibilities to each partner, where two or more organizations coordinate
closely to plan and execute supply chain operations toward common goals and mutual
interests (Moshtari, 2016). Engagement is identified connecting to the massive need for
collaboration among multiple actors. Even though initiative supports lead to the improved
collaborative performance, a lack of unanimous agreement exists between partners, as each
partner is used to work independently. Interviewees from the consultant company mentioned
that HOs are often reluctant to provide their feedback or support to test a new technology.
Form the list of main barriers, the importance of regulatory problems and lack of technical
skills and training has been noted in the literature. Sahebi et al. (2020) identify “regulatory
uncertainty” and “the lack of knowledge/employee training” as the most important barriers.
However, there is no consensus in the literature about the importance of “privacy concerns”.
Patil et al. (2021) recognize “data privacy, ownership and security issues” as a significant
barrier, while Sahebi et al. (2020) categorize “privacy risks” among the least important
barriers. The importance of barriers is a critical aspect for practice as HOs need to prioritize
and develop mitigation plans to address issues accordingly. As such, the divergence between
the importance levels could be misleading.
Among the main barriers, to the best of our knowledge, the barrier “lack of resources” has
been vaguely discussed in the literature. The term “resources” also covers the knowledge on
what resources are required for the blockchain, budget, cost of the pilot and implementation,
skills, know-how, training, and quality data. Since the blockchain application is in its early
stage, the survey results show that there is lack of knowledge on what resources are required
for the blockchain application among the multiple actors including the government, HOs,
beneficiaries and local communities. Patil et al. (2021) partly refer to this barrier through the
barrier “technological complexities” and rank this barrier as a relatively high influence factor.
In our case study, some interviewees connected the resource issues with the size of
organizations and their affordability to use the technology. To address the barrier, Patil et al.
(2021) call for synergetic cooperation between blockchain developers, donors, HOs and other
HSC stakeholders. Similarly, the academic participants of our focus group noted the

opportunities to use available resources from the business sector through effective
collaboration. However, we noted that practitioners were somewhat reluctant in
supporting cross-sector partnerships, and they commonly referred to different working
language and norms. Interviewees commented that the barrier is not new to the sector, but
issues with cross-sector collaborations are yet to be solved gradually.
Although the pilot scalability issue and governance problems received moderate scores in
the focus group discussion (possibly due to a lack of understanding about the technology and
its implications, Coppi and Fast, 2019), the case study showed that they could be important
impeding factors to consider. In this regard, our case study findings support existing
literature. For instance, Demir et al. (2020) note the governance of the blockchain system as a
remarkable implementation issue and contend that “even Bitcoin blockchain has a team that
develops the software and maintains the system”. In our case, interviewees remained vague
in answering questions regarding the likelihood of a scale-up of the project and governance
problems. Interviewees provided insight on the fact that the level of interest expressed by
HOs is still low, as large HOs want to experiment with their projects first. Experts noted that
blockchain is very much in its ideational and infancy stage.
RQ2. Could evidence support that the application of blockchain improves transparency
and trust in HSCs?
Given the definition of transparency that we follow in our study (cf. Section 1), we examine the
added value in terms of transparency through the contribution of blockchain to visibility and
traceability. We note that visibility received a high average score in our focus group
discussions. Improved visibility was also among the top frequently mentioned added values
of blockchain application to HSC in the pilot in our interviews. In the business literature (e.g.
Caridi et al., 2010; Wang and Wei, 2007), several conceptual measures have been introduced to
assess the SC visibility such as evaluating information exchanges within the SC. Caridi et al.
(2010) focus on the quantity and quality of information communicated to stakeholders
according to timeliness and accuracy. Wang and Wei (2007) investigate information visibility
according to process (e.g. production status) and completeness of information provided to or
received from stakeholders. Our interviewees referred to the information completeness as a
given feature in the pilot since all partners knew each other before engaging into the pilot:
There was an agreement of what is supposed to be shared with stakeholders on the
blockchain-based system. In the meantime, interviewees commonly agreed that the
timeliness, accuracy and process-related features of information were considerably
improved in the pilot. The main added value about visibility was that pilot partners could
access information related to operations of the entire HSC in the pilot, besides the activities in
which they participated. However, interviewees acknowledged that the benefits of using
blockchain to improve visibility in a scaled project (with several participants) can hardly be
realized through a private architecture. Several scholars have criticized the use of private-
permissioned blockchain in humanitarian projects (e.g. Baharmand et al., 2021) as these
solutions make it unclear who is the real beneficiary of the enhanced visibility. As one focus
group participant mentioned, “we must be clear that the benefits occur to the HOs, not [to] the
beneficiaries or end users, who may not even know that blockchain is being used.” Interviewees
found public protocols a more reliable and attractive option for HSCs, although it should be
noted that having publicly available immutable record of all actors in a blockchain network
might produce undesired consequences for HOs responding to politically sensitive crises.
Compared to traceability, we note that SC visibility is relatively a new stream in the
literature (Sodhi and Tang, 2019). The research on the impact of blockchain on SC visibility is
therefore scant. In the business literature, some studies have suggested to measure the SC
traceability by focusing on the ability of the system to capture, store and transmit adequate
information that enables the product to be checked for safety, quality control and location at

any point in the SC (Morgan et al., 2018). Several quotes from interviewees show that this
ability was significantly improved in the pilot. Interviewees from consultant partner admitted
that in the humanitarian sector, due to organizational changes over time, large HOs might
have between 50 and 80 legacy enterprise resource planning systems, which often do not
easily communicate with one another and may even differ in how they define data fields. This
makes traceability a huge challenge to solve in practice. However, in the pilot project, if a
partner had discovered a faulty relief item, the blockchain could enable the HO and other
partners to trace the item, identify all suppliers involved with it, identify production and
shipment batches associated with it and efficiently recall it. Our interviewees admitted that in
the pilot project, data concerning the shipped relief items were recorded on the blockchain
manually, which could challenge quality control in real operations. However, some
interviewees highlighted that a blockchain-based HSC (combined with Internet of things)
could record any fluctuation (for instance with respect to temperature) and allow partners to
monitor quality automatically. This is specifically relevant for HOs since perishable relief
items are often included in humanitarian disasters response.
Concerning trust, to the best of our knowledge, there is no consensus in the literature
regarding how to measure the concept in HSC. We use the highly cited Stephenson’s (2005)
conceptualization of trust in disaster relief operations as a foundation to understand and
measure trust in HSC. Based on the typologies provided earlier by the commercial research,
Stephenson (2005) recognizes four types of trust namely companion, competence,
commitment and swift. Accordingly, Dubey et al. (2019) contend that commitment trust
and swift trust are more applicable to hastily formed HSCs in disasters response.
Commitment trust is based on contractual agreements, rules, processes and procedures
between the parties which can be both verbal and written. Swift trust is a form of trust
occurring in temporary teams based on contextual cues (rather than inter-personal ties),
particularly when there is time pressure or achieving project goals is of great importance.
Regarding the impact of blockchain on trust, literature suggests that blockchain has a
significant effect on swift trust (e.g. Dubey et al., 2020). Our study confirms such an effect,
although our interviewees referred to commitment trust more than swift trust. This could be
due to the smart contracts feature of the blockchain application in the pilot which facilitated
trade and follow up in the project. Concerning swift trust, interviewees highlighted the easy
access to the “time-stamped” and “encrypted” information stored on the “decentralized”,
“permanent”, “searchable”, “immutable” records repository which in-principle should
improve building rapid trust between HSC actors in real-world humanitarian operations.
Moreover, Dubey et al. (2020) found a direct link between transparency and swift trust. In our
study, the evidence from the pilot showed the added value of blockchain to increase HSC
transparency (through enhancing visibility and traceability). Thus, we conclude that the
blockchain had added value to improve swift trust as well.
6.2 Contributions to theory
Based on our results, we can argue that our study offers some useful contributions to theory.
First, there is an agreement in the literature that blockchain adoption in HSCs can offer
several performance improvements; however, to date, little is known about what the real
added values and challenges of blockchain application to HSC can be. Due to high uncertainty
and dynamics of HSCs, visibility and data tracing have proved to be challenging (Altay et al.,
2018). Some researchers propose that blockchain holds promise to enhance SC visibility and
data tracing, and therefore, it has potential to improve HSC transparency in HSC. However,
Dubey et al. (2020) call for evidence-based studies with multiple methods to further examine
the added value of blockchain to HSC. Findings from our evidence-based study clearly
suggest that blockchain can improve transparency and trust in HSC.

--- Page 18 ---
Second, our study contributes theoretically to the contingent RBV. The successful
application of the blockchain to HSCs is contingent depending on certain contextual barriers
and challenges such as access to and availability of resources, the quality of technological
infrastructure, local knowledge and literacy and regulatory issues. Barriers are considered as
contingent factors that HOs need to take into account for the blockchain application. Previous
research shows how relief operations along HSC were constrained with certain barriers. These
constraints included, but were not limited to, the unpredictable dynamic environment, fluid and
uncertain information, demand–supply risks, poor planning for prepositioning of supplies and
more importantly the lack of advanced technological infrastructure (Mishra et al., 2020).
Moreover, our research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of implementation
considerations and creates a perspective for HSC scholars. Our findings reflect that literature
and theoretical works often put much weight on the drivers rather than barriers when
discussing blockchain applications in HSCs. However, our case study findings (the number
and the impact of) indicate that challenges with respect to engagement, skills, resources,
privacy and governance can be critically important. Since drivers and barriers can evolve and
change from one project to the other, we intend to reinforce the relevance of detailed
investigations of pilot projects in future studies to provide pathways for the scaled
implementation phase.
6.3 Implications for practice
Our research has several implications for practice. First, we provide lessons from the proof of
technology stage of a real case showing that blockchain can contribute to the accountability,
visibility, traceability and trust in HSCs. Our research grounds findings in an empirical study.
As such, this study provides first insights for practice beyond the many conceptual research,
literature reviews, blog posts and studies that consider (publicly available) high-level use case
descriptions only. We provide new insights by discussing drivers and barriers with
practitioners interested in blockchain technology through a structured focused group
discussion. Moreover, our case study is among the first ones in the HSC literature that goes
deeper into the implementation process of blockchain in HSCs.
Our study proves with evidence from the field that there are still several barriers that need
to be addressed for the effective application of blockchain to HSCs. Although we cannot
neglect the added value of blockchain for improving accountability, visibility, traceability
and trust, we think that probably traditional centralized file-sharing systems are currently
more efficient and better IT solutions than a relatively complex private permissioned
blockchain-based system for HSC. Some interviewees referred to the pilot as “an
overengineered solution for targeted objectives”. That said, we suggest that the decision
regarding whether to use blockchain or not should follow a detailed assessment workflow in
the chain and among (all) the SC actors. After such an assessment, as suggested by focus
group participants, piloting blockchain is among the best alternatives to explore the added
values and assess trade-offs. While we received no reference data, two interviewees from
commercial partners of the project confirmed that piloting blockchain in HSCs with limited
number of actors (maximum five) can be relatively easy and inexpensive.
7. Conclusions
Humanitarian assistance is marked by large numbers of actors and agencies with different
mandates, objectives, systems, data sets and processes. As these actors rush to help alleviate the
sufferings of disaster-affected people in the shortest time, the result is usually a lack of end-to-
end visibility and traceability plus fragmented and opaque HSCs prone to delays and waste and
corruption. In HSCs, trust and transparency are often low, which hinders effective and efficient

of blockchain technology in HSC to address transparency and trust issues through a
multimethod approach: a focus group with multiple practitioners interested in the technology
and a case study of DFID’s Pilot project. We outlined a validated list of drivers and barriers
(cf. Section 6.1) and provided evidence concerning blockchain had shown added value to
improve HSC transparency and trust in practice. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the
first to empirically explore blockchain application to HSCs. It contributes to the operations and
supply chain management by adding empirical findings beyond the scope of available research.
Our research opens some future research avenues as well. First, our study is based on
insights and opinions of a limited set of experts. We acknowledge that experts came from
large HOs in a tech-wealthy region, while in other organizations or countries, the different
access to resources, partners, skills and knowledge could result in a different perception of
bottlenecks, deficiencies and points-of-improvement. As such, one future research direction
could be to involve more experts. Second, we could study only one pilot project and were not
able to cross-check the findings with other deployments. To the best of our knowledge, we
studied what is considered the only known blockchain-based HSC case. As DFID advances
their project into scale or other HOs implement similar projects, there would be an
opportunity to learn more through expanding the number of cases or exploring the
implementation in other geographic areas or scenarios. Third, we found some discrepancies
between the findings from the two methods and the literature that should be further explored.
Fourth, drivers and barriers in HSC downstream should be studied separately. HOs face
several challenges in the downstream part of HSC, which interestingly was not in the scope of
the studied pilot but seemingly planned for a future project (DFID, 2019).
